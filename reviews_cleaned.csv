Not very friendly patient our many question the menu; wa also extremely knowledgeable; flawlessly offering recommendation what order (pro tip: we had the marlin crudo shark his recommendation; it's probably safe just go whatever's fresh).I'm big oyster a J; we went on a dozen; two each kind from all the coast . I say this tasting exercise wa fun enlightening; though! I discovered I prefer brinier oyster general . Winners the Pemaquid Dunbar Farms . The Dodge Cove oyster impressively huge; I'm size queen - give a delicious and manageable mouthful; I'd rather spend half hour chewing get food my throat.We were pleasantly surprised the end our meal an unexpected plate of whiskey cake! It reminded of pound cake; made a perfectly satisfying semi-sweet ending our light yet satisfying meal (paired some milk stout).I definitely need wait le ten year making a return run to Upstate . And J's reaction any indication; might drag me back much much sooner ;.",5.0 star rating
45,1,This place every bit good review state . My dad I came on Saturday night barring 90 minute wait . We reserved place line Yelp 60 minute prior; restaurant; hostess said she'd seat u few party later . We wandered around nearby Rite Aid good half hour finally got seat bar . We'd hoping tabletop such long wait; hostess promise table u once one became available apparently never happened.We started beer wine; I got one daily beer special incredible . We ordered small plate - sockeye salmon; crab cake; the trout . The salmon favorite; fresh came bread a delightful mustard spread paired perfectly . The crab cake a little floury I prefer; though flavorful perfectly crispy edge . The salad camen't my favorite; the dressing a weird combination sweet spicy . The trout good; could use a bit flavor also crisped well . The tomato mozzarella side potato gnocchi came were absolutely incredible.My dad I were still hungry we ordered the fettuccine clam all . Guys; we were completely blown the water . This the dish need ordering! The entire pot steaming fragrant . The clam were unbelievably fresh; garlic every bite; quantity generous . The pasta wa somehow even better; wa cheesy; the point you grab a forkful cheese ooze pull your plate . In't know I've ever had such great pasta; it wa good . I say the dish wa awfully heavy; so I'm glad we share rather order individually . We left full happy very impressed with our experience! I wish the seating / wait system wa a little organized otherwise are complaint . Will definitely be back try more of the menu (oyster!! ),4.0 star rating

49,1,I Upstate bookmarked Yelp hot minute I finally chance try cousin her friend (somewhat) area low-key Speakeasy tour (Death & Co; PDT; Angels' Share; etc). It's rare I'm THIS disappointed place number rave review . I know In't order incorrectly; either; I pasta with clam; seems be go-to dish . My cousin's friend; my cousin ordered scallop . Now; I give Upstate credit credit due - particularly inexpensive seafood Manhattan . With acknowledged; I feel like I've said everything positive I needed say . I found pasta be bland uninspired the clam incredibly chewy somewhat room temperature well . My cousin's friend felt exactly the same way; my cousin blown away her scallop . The food easily 3/5 - atrocious; I wouldn't even go far call good . I'm taking away extra star despite the restaurant being super slow (I think a Sunday something theren't a ton people there) the service even slower . We timed took close hour the time we ordered our pasta come . I almost never ask the server the food I used work restaurant know a lot the time's nobody's fault...come; an hour really; really bad . I be able order a pork chop well done and it take long . The restaurant your typical bumf*ck East Village hole the wall - pretty narrow and cramped; nothing exceptional . The beer selection isn't anything special . The complimentary pound cake the end our meal wa a nice touch; like the pasta; wan't good . It tasted like cheap grocery store pound cake . I wanted to go to dinner not to my grandma's nursing home potluck . TL; DR - had to try it eventually; disappointed I . Will not return,2.0 star rating

The sauce tasted like various type cheese + ton garlic; can mean party my taste bud . Gosh; I salivating thinking this dish . The oyster + beer special : 6 oyster + beer $12 ($ 16 wine) happy hour last 5-7 every single day . How great that? The special had oyster only briny one; I still found quite flavorful even though I normally gravitate toward sweet one . I ended getting two order of this . Crab cake: I believe this best deal crab cake can get the city! The crab meat is bountiful seared just perfectly each side that beautiful crust . It tasted buttery delicious .

The menu overall change basically every night depending able get fresh fish; mostly coastal New England . First; oyster are delicious . Many option; always rotating based fresh . The appetizer also change constantly; thankfully bartender able give a sample (stuffed pepper tuna; scallop). The go order linguine clam; is not a typical thing I would order . However; NYC Kim is trying new thing; I tried; pleasantly surprised . It wa delicious; flavorful; buttery . The clam fresh; 10; to surprise I enjoyed . The fettuchine wa fresh homemade . In't know what Gster would got he came; they basically seafood menu . They give a complintary whiskey cake dessert is dense; flavorful clean the pallate the seafood flavor .

Fettuccine clam: this is actually salty dish compared the mussel . Very salty be honest . The clam seasoned great; the fettuccine over seasoned; lot . Service pretty decent; asked we were doing 2 time . The seat I sat wa next the bar; the waiter bumped my seat lot even though I sat super close the table . So you; avoid seat .

But; seemed love second walked; I stayed . And; boy I glad I . Everything absolutely perfect . Even French guy running place seated u; gave bit French attitude; perfect.The oyster fresh absolutely good selection . (We quickly boosted order 1/2 dozen dozen .) The tuna tartare; delish . (And; trust; lately our luck finding decent tuan tartare had epic disappointment .) He love escargot . So I . But; let's admit it . Most time; it's really about butter butter dipping the bread . LOL.I'm a Foie Gras person . Jayson loved his.After a few minute; kind forgot you in a tiny space the vibe wa so good food good expected.My recommendation .

155,2,Amelie package deal! Food; ambiance; service...everything restaurant such high quality one Manhattan I wouldn't mind revisiting . I went Amelie first time last summer came back this summer both experience absolutely delightful . There's pink aura restaurant either inviting distracting depending who I embraced very welcoming vibe . Both visit; I ordered ravioli gratin . They're mini raviola pasta stuffed comte cottage cheese flavor rich; not an overwhelming sense . It's perfect pasta dish me the balance cheese; warmth; portion--also $16 relatively inexpensive compared other pasta dish'll find dinner menu Manhattan . Being French restaurant; serve free bread a the appetizer . Although I've better French bread; I'll never complain free appetizer! The space is quite small so I would recommend making reservation you can . Before 6:30 any evening be safe; the restaurant start filling very quickly 6:30; especially weekend .

This might be the decked out board I've ever ordered; I blissfully savored bite; mixing matching thing together till felt like my tongue doing cartwheel . I also ordered the charred Spanish octopus come a ratatouille harissa aioli . I know sound busy; a bit compared the thing I ordered; the octopus really; really good . It might the most tender I've been served; the char perfect . If want to focus on texture flavor; get without the aioli even you keep on; it won't distract much it sound like it will .

How nice her! We ended staying our original side table; fine! We ordered crab cake our appetizer pretty good . A lil pricey; hey; longn't suck; a good try . Will try something else next time though.We ordered the 1.5 lb lobster 1 lb shrimp combo the u share . Everything so tasty; the only thing would've made it better would corn potato! It stated the menu that there would 1 corn 1 potato per 2 lb order . I assumed it would a whole corn a whole potato; it wa more like 1/3 a whole corn 4 small piece of potato . And I guess the combon't meant sharing? I wa satisfied the of un't full . Next time we know order more seafood more corn potato! Overall; amazing experience; great food; definitely recommend!,5.0 star rating
262,3,I'll always remember The Boil place I peeled first crawfish . I watched how-to video Youtube beforehand . There's whole method involves twisting; pinching; peeling . Some peel more successful others.Anyway; The Boil fun spot friend I found looking place eat oyster; althoughn't actually end eating oyster . We eat 1 1/2 lb . lobster & 1 lb . crawfish combo; though; may destroyed surface our table process (despite paper cover). Our waitress sort woefully shook head our table . The seafood fresh delicious; special Boil sauce; I think combination garlic butter; spice; lemon pepper; old bay; triple dip-worthy . We ordered the mild; actually indeed mildly spicy . The garlic butter the old bay the noticeable flavor . A tasty piece corn potato also thrown the bag; nice touch.We still need some food ordered two side: the Mac n cheese crab slider . The mac some slightly pungent cheese breadcrumb wan't overly cheesy; I liked . The crab slider fried reminded u crab cake . They're good substantial supplement the meal; certainly the main draw here.I also ordered Bloody Mary; wa well-balanced a fun cajun spice twist . I didn't like my friend' cocktail much; were overly sweet . I remember one person got the bayou juice; it wa just way sugary me.The space a lot bigger it look upon first glance; there's a medium-sized room the back . We came a Sunday evening were actually able get a table right away walk-in; something I wa not expecting given the restaurant had no available reservation that time . It WAS pouring outside; may had something do the ease which got a table.,4.0 star rating

For this price; better be the biggest freshest oyster the city . 3- lobster - actual lobster delicious . Be prepared put bib break apart . The sauce ordered; the house sauce that's a mix everything; extremely garlicky (good); so I liked slurping up; extremely salty (bad). Meant be one person; we shared .

And seasoning pretty point . Itn't seasonedn't lacking flavor whatsoever . Theyn't skimp the garlic I love even though I know probably use decent amount butter; didn't feel oily overwhelming actually felt mildly refreshing . I could probably eat like 5 bag my face I had the money blow seafood like . The people working seemed pretty cool . I overheard the bartender messing one the customer order next u (were the bar) I very impressed how handled the situation even wa able build really good rapport the customer .

285,3,My friend previously lived NYC recommended restaurant u . After I showed Mink picture food; sold going . It reminded food one her favorite place eat Bay Area . After long day walking; caught Uber but easy find catching subway . There crowd people outside can't miss place . It's 1.5-2 hour waitn't get first seating . This probably due their popularity their 1.5 hour time limit dine . They enforce (server table next u gave a friendly reminder of time limit about going expire). Having rule a busy place great . It keep everything running smoothly guest enjoy experience equally . When you enter; you'll notice their cool decor the bar the right . There also a dining area the back that's le busy the front .

Don't sit the back unless want sweat profusely your clothing smell like fried food.Furthermore; I can't imagine they serve Cajun food not unsweetened sweet tea . The shrimp & calm the buttery garlic sauce winner . The fried catfish basket not we anticipated . By basket; it wa a small portion fry; 3 small piece catfish; a bite cole slaw . We also got the fried soft shell crab wa merely one very small soft softshell crab fry cole slaw . Not worth $12 my opinion . We ate food; paid the tab couldn't wait get of .

326,3,Just FYI everyone: place cash-only . I die-hard cajun boil fan I've hearing this place i decided give shot.First; food good . It reallyn't matter type seafood order- garlic butter sauce literally amazing point I took sauce home used cook next day . We came Monday night a party four around 8:30 . After a twenty minute wait sat ordered appetizer . We got soft shell crab fried perfectly served Cajun fry . We also got fried calamari ok; nothing amazing . For boil ordered shrimp; snow crab leg; lobster . Most place I've to throw complimentary corn potato you order two pound seafood regardless what is; very stern that had to be two pound type seafood . (Was a little annoyed that I usually one pound crab leg one pound shrimp mixed...all wa forgiven I opened the bag tasted the sauce). Their garlic bread is surprisingly good . It seems like's a toasted hamburger bun wa actually quite delicious useful scooping sauce . Oh also; I believe they add 20% gratuity party 4 more is a big deal after tax and tip; it came to $273 wa a little pricey . But again; we were absolutely stuffed delicious food!,4.0 star rating

Either way; I definitely come back!!!,4.0 star rating
332,3,I ABSOLUTELY loved time place!!! I torn coming another popular Cajun restaurant I settled according research The Boil make spicier item place . I traveled hour come here but definitely worth trek . Since I wa there myself; I ordered crawfish shrimp came corn (potato I believe). I grew eating spicy food normally I dine certain restaurant NY; anywhere U.S. matter; In't usually think food spicy establishment claim . In case; The Boil definitely left impression--the fact prepared order close the spicy level I'm used; impressed . There two thing The Boil I kind feel iffy (one than the other though). The first that only open 5pm mean I either wait find way occupy my time --n't major issue me ;'s that food good I'm eager sit start eating lol . The second that they wheel the garbage the area everyone is seated me is bit unpleasant . No one want have garbage near food; is I opted sit the bar--le likely have wheeled so close to you due to table between your back turned . With that being said; I love this place and will definitely be coming back.,5.0 star rating

I want say might something do the fact the employee speaking Cantonese (thus may be Thailand); the fact it seems strange single restaurant serve Thai; Malaysian; Vietnamese food; hey; maybe I'm wrong.I also deduct star service abysmal . When check; get free small Thai iced tea . I showed the coupon waiter he took order; he acknowledged it and nodded; and then it never came . We actuallyn't see again the rest the evening someone else brought our food the table; that wa that . No checking u; small talk asking we; fact wan't even a hello .

Theyn't skimp on protein either . It's tough to branch try new dish since they get it right every time . Mango Sticky Rice ($ 6) - I could honestly polish two these on my own . So good . Perfect balance sweet; tangy; and creamy . Thai iced tea ($ 4) - Love that mini version is on the house you check! It's overly sweet like many drink condensed milk end being .

Since a table 6; decided order a bunch dish share family-style . Cold Noodles (Peanut Sesame Sauce) - OK; much potential . For typical peanut sauce noodle; lo mein used; so made u scratch head a bit.Uncle Plump's Dumplings - Really good probably one better dish we ordered . There 6 piece order I loved peanut sauce dumplings.BBQ Char Sui Buns - Absolute disappointment . The BBQ pork some worst I've ever had . This definitely go the 'do order' list.Roti Canai Planta - OK. Not great; not bad either . It what is; roti canai.Thai Fried Chicken Wings - Very tasty flavorful . The wing were basted well.Pad See Eew - Surprisingly decent one the dish table finished up.Thai Fried Rice - Not bad.Sambal String Beans - On the spicy side some my tablemate; I thought had the right kick it . Rendang Nasi Lemak - Our tablen't try much; the meat pretty tender tasty.Grilled Chicken Vermicelli Noodle - I thought this done pretty close how it is cooked Viet restaurant so prop them for making the vermicelli correctly.Thai Iced Tea - Watered not good all . One the worst Thai Iced Teas I ever had.Overall; the food OK . There wan't one stand dish made go``I need come back"".

I surprised only receive 2 small dumpling 1 eggroll the combined 2 appetizer . I didn't know 1 eggroll would serve one appetizer itself . The dumpling also okay - good great pork dumpling . My picky self decided not eat the mushroom eggroll; In't like mushroom; my boyfriend said okay.The Mee Goreng noodle tasty! They looked spicy based the color alone; more savory a kick! The size the noodle good - could probably serve 1.5-2 meal; depending much can eat . The Rendang Nasi Lemak very strong aromatic - can either good bad depending on how much one love curry . My boyfriend LOVES curry; this the perfect meal him! It a bit strong me; something I loved that wan't heavily drowning curry sauce; unlike curry dish I eaten . My favorite part the dish wa the egg topped spice . The natural taste egg seemed lighten the powerful taste the spice - they compliment other well!

The coffee alright; I would enjoyed cup clean.The tom yum not clear broth I used in Thai place . It seems like mix curry? Again; ingredient not listed menu In't know would come tomatoes.My friend ordered mango salad came drenched dressing . Would like mango with your lime juice? We not enjoy vegetable dumpling all . Both friend dumpling lover they said filling good the dumpling wrapper too thick . I intrigued so I took a bite honestly I couldn't tell it a dumpling a sandwich.My friend done eating I still chewing when the server came asked I wanted a container . Rude much? I understand need new costumer like 8 empty table we barely there 30 min . Then; they brought back my credit card; came take the check In't even done signing! I gotten the check 10 second I putting my credit card away first . I would been more sympathetic if this place packed; then again; it wan't .

425,4,Maybe's fault getting anything Vietnamese supposed be main thing; I think I generally expected little more.I came my partner Saturday night around 8 . They manage seat u relatively quickly; service followingn't great . We got appetizer our entree; little weird/annoying; not catastrophic . We also got Thai Iced Tea opposed Vietnamese coffee ordered; our water glass not really refilled point . That said; utterly slammed ;'s somewhat understandable forgivable.The appetizer actually pretty darn good; we probably made meal those . Uncle Plump's dumpling nice chili/peanut flavor pleasing texture; the Thai chicken wing salty; savory; sweet crunchy goodness . The Char Sui bun the best thing the table; decent chunk pork a wonderfully flavorful Hoisin-like sauce; nestled inside a puffy; chewy bao bun.The entree were not good . The pad thai decent; really decent . I think I expected for it being the most popular entree a restaurant so many rave . The red curry downright bland had little eggplant; bell pepper; chicken; consisting largely just long bean onion slice a too-thin coconut milk . It also served without a side rice; I've never seen . I'm still not sure wa another glitch the service; just bad menu planning . I wa also slightly confused the fact they say the menu that their curry paste freshly-pounded; then have jar Mae Ploy over the restaurant.In any case; I would advise treating this place like a tapa dim sum restaurant ordering several appetizer foregoing entree altogether.,3.0 star rating
426,4,Love place! Great Thai/Malaysian place East Village; here least 4 time the past year . The curry particularly delicious the spice level get pretty high . Also big fan the Thai iced tea; used free coupon that yelp check . The issue I've is the service/atmosphere; since can get quite crowded peak hour .

433,4,"Lured lavish high praise previous Yelpers I decided give' college try since Yelp``try""bookmark list long time.Atmosphere ambiance neither presentable inviting . It appears worn time space added possibly three time hand-me-down . It seemingly appears family owned operated .

Love Mama a multi Asian cuisine serf Thai; Vietnamese; Malaysian concocts quality entree home cooking Mama . Of course; Mama know best...you listen Mama?

I truly enjoyed this entree it is prepared the traditional way . I not particularly care the bit scrambled egg I regard it irrelevant . The shrimp; sadly; appears overcooked not fresh . I usually not intake spicy food a it is not cup tea; I open intake immerse ethnic food cuisine cultural food . The salvation the medium heat spicy index mouth wa the Thai ice tea it contains milk .

435,4,It's unfortunate trying go Hanoi House (then Madame Vo) landed . Who knew'd busy 7pm weeknight? I somehow bookmarked LoveMama; I suggested friend . The menu looked pretty good; even tiny bit expensive type Asian food so close Chinatown . Unfortunately; everything ordered fell completely flat - mediocre best; overcooked it worst . The food: + Roti Canai - This one my FAVORITE thing order; I never resist . How go wrong beyond . It more expensive; much smaller; thicker oiler usual roti canai (Nyonya; Wok Wok; Taste Good Malaysian; etc). It not crispy all tasted like thick; oily dough . The vegetarian lentil curry dipping sauce interesting; not particularly good . + Pho - Since originally hoping go Hanoi House Madame Vo; natural my friend ordered pho . The broth not bad (pretty typical I usually get); we initially amazed amount meat bowl . Unfortunately; joy ended we took bite - meat waaay overcooked . In general; pho meat thin almost raw the middle; cook the hot broth . I not want eat more the meat all . My friend left bowl uneaten . + Seafood Laksa - I can personally never resist ordering this whenever I see it menu (Wok Wok; Taste Good Malaysian; Obao; etc). The broth actually pretty solid - on par others I've - the rest the dish really disappointing . The noodle overcooked; the shrimp tasted (looked) like came preprepared frozen package; not much else . + Pad Thai (?) - At least; I think's what my friend got? It one the Thai dish; this definitely the best dish of everything we got . The chicken overcooked; the noodle were only a tiny bit overcooked the sauce flavorful good . Overall; the food leaf a lot desired; this area; there is SO much better food to be . The service wa good; we all got free Thai iced tea (one of un't even check); there wa no wait .

I told server told chef . When returned said toldn't spoiled added much lemon . She gave a fresh one I'm sorry only tasted slightly better . I put side when she came around I told I didn't like . Now back the dry tasteless burger disappointing . I pretty much to drown ketchup to make it taste decent . I disappointed because I wa starving I ate the fry the burger . They definitely expanded menu I'm sure wa beneficial to them; focus now spread on various item and itn't seem the kitchen staff handle it .

(2) involves variable pricing rather the flat $20 across offering used be appealing (ex: now a whole lobster up $30 a roll $20-25).

These meal fit comfortable our tummy accompanied the cider; twas a great choice . No desert a they had the chocolate cake thatn't going end well me . lolPlease note that Aubrey Carter were the people serving theyn't miss a beat . There never a feeling of;``dam's my food/drink? ``; instead the general feeling wa;``wow; that came quickly"". Huge thanks both of you for making another date night a success . Ambiance : 5/5Service : 5/5Staff : 5/5Food : 5/5Drinks : 5/5 (get the cider with bourbon....just do it) Cash and credit happily accepted...plz tip in cash you can.We'll back ;)... date night list coming soon",5.0 star rating

581,6,2 1/2 star realistically . We came based great Yelp review; i'm sure they highly rated based my experience . I wouldn't back . I hoping much . Upon arrival promptly greeted waitress tried seat u communal table . I'm sure there anything I hate communal seating . I'm spending $40 head crammed some stranger butt i've never met; do I want hear entire conversation . I asked non communal table luckily couple open & accommodated otherwise'd gone elsewhere . Once seated; ordered two drink . They came very quickly; accept I ordered a glass red wine a glass white sent me . The waitress quickly took away ;n't replaced what I actually ordered a good . The red finally came tart side near spoiled . Since I used be a waitress; I never like send stuff back unless's totally undrinkable; so I dealt . We ordered entree; mussel shrimp grit pretty quickly . These also took forever be served . Upon seeing the presentation; I quite impressed the mussel . The shrimp grit were just ok looking . Upon diving the dish my fork I shocked find shallow how little food portion there $21 . I hoped it would be good enough make for but itn't . Honestly; flavorful a sucking a cardboard box . The shrimp wa completely flavorless the entire dish wa under seasoned . The mussel were far better than my dish; the broth they came wa the highlight the meal . The vibe here wa a lot people looking at the hockey sport the tv's is my thing . Overall; dinner wa just really disappointing many level given expectation.,3.0 star rating

586,6,Really great spot BK! Came Sunday brunch friend pleasantly surprised food . Got chicken waffle (course!) DELICIOUS . Really better expected - chicken juicy tender (bone either I like) waffle sweet fluffy . The dipping sauce the chicken also delicious - really good! The drink solid expensive . I got the Irish Coffee - wa literally whiskey some coffee whipped cream . But actually tasted pretty good! Then got the Guy's mule wa good refreshing . Really nice drink! Thisn't a lively brunch place; though . At least Sundays . So're looking for a place a fun; energetic vibe; it . It is way low key you actually catch whoever you're dining with . The service wa good first once people came; it slowed . I would be attentive your customer throughout whole meal . But; overall; okay service . Awesome place . Would recommend.,4.0 star rating
587,6,We gave place 4 try . I really think staff (including chef) left last year place went hell . The first time went last year; decent . Now? What heck going?? Service- 2/5Food 2/5 It's good . And sadly ;'s pretty disappointing's hard mess gastropub food . My fiancé I went with group; it straight took 25 min 1 cocktail . Forget another one . Prior that; messed salmon (freezing cold middle- even kinda edible-'re talking reallllly not edible) shrimp grit soaking some weird oil . It wa bad; comped drink . If the happens or twice; I'd more forgiving 3/4 time; it just becomes our fault being fool going back . I wannalike this place; idk . Theyn't seem really care; so youn't either . Save the trip,2.0 star rating

589,6,"I really want give 5 star I can't.We walked around 3:30pm (odd time; I know) informed brunch menu ended kitchen open yet dinner . We offered sit table kitchen opened back half hour come back . We decided sit a table friend haven't seen awhile big deal chat them meantime (plus's freezing outside).Things going well . We introduced waiter Andrew said'll taking care u night . Good intro digging vibe restaurant (loved the decoration). He took drink order everything went well . Later came back the kitchen opened took dinner order . Shortly; someone else came with our food the kitchen . He brought 3 plate (probably max could carry) came with the last plate (mine) 2 minute later . No big deal except shrimp grit's I ordered . I gave a confused look toldn't mine . I saw walk Andrew talk saw walk back the kitchen . During time; I never got communication . No ``'re sorry""no ``'d order ...?""no``we'll working fixing order right away .""NOTHING . So I told friend start eating halfway meal still no one the restaurant wa letting know what's going . Should I even expecting dinner this point? Eventually boyfriend asked the other waitress since looked like Andrew turned the bartender never came back our table check u never told u wan't taking care u anymore . We politely asked if knew what wa going with meal.. in the work least? She went back to the kitchen came back and never gave u update . Okayyyyyy....Eventually all the friend finished eating their meal; dinner finally arrived . So I ended eating while everyone else watched . In't mind that the restaurant messed my order ('s not great happens ...). I'm upset how handled . No apology and no communication what's going . Because the horrible service; I wa expecting to see a discount my meal even comping it . Not even that . Anyway I give it a 1 service especially given it wan't a super busy night . I'm adding the additional star the food wa legitimately good . I ordered the short rib grilled cheese; come with side fry.",2.0 star rating

The place cozy wooden-cabin feel; not the flannel type . Thanks Yelp; got a free glass wine; which we paired with: Pork Tenderloin a mushroom sauce; a Salmon Fillet partner . The wine better we expected; 15 short minute; entree came . Unfortunately got my side dish wrong (roasted brussel sprout) I brought string bean (haricot; their menu) instead; they made amends bringing me a side brussel sprout addition 10 minute later . I appreciated they acknowledged the error tried make . My partner's salmon excellent; the side asparagus lacked any flavour; simply boiled; only saving grace the slather of butter around . My string bean brussel sprout especially good; the mushroom gravy the tenderloin really a lot my hungry belly . Everything good; the tenderloin lacked nuance in my opinion.We ended having additional drink - a Mezcal special my partner; the Grapefruit/gin drink for me . Both incredibly well done for cocktail set $11; it wa really a bargain.Overall; we enjoyed experience Uglyduckling I appreciated the service.,4.0 star rating

652,6,We neighborhood looking breakfast around 11:00am this seemed like one best option . We gasped little price; $19 breakfast taco; something like $22 french toast . Regardless; rush decided give try . We opted the avocado toast; given the most reasonable item the menu whopping $10 (Cafe Gitane in the city; ha the BEST avocado toast charge $7.25). UGLYDUCKLING HOME TO THE WORST AVOCADO TOAST IN ALL OF NEW YORK CITY . The bread stale; then toasted . So a cracker texture crumbled cracked you ate . It wan't a thick slice fresh; moist multi-grain; wa store bought - probably a month ago . The fried jalapeno looked like large booger placed top a brown/green overripe avocado spread . The spread avocado wa meager best; again tasted of an avocado started rot . Sadly; I wish I had better thing say; the staff were really nice . The kitchen need step their game; use better ingredient justify outrageous price.,2.0 star rating

Well day finally came said done I say I'm only upset didn't come sooner! We arrived around 11 AM had previously made reservation party two . When I walked I surprised how INSANELY busy . Seriously ;n't come without making reservation . By time arrived wait time 45 hour range.When spot ready hostess walked u back restaurant sat u one long communal table the back . The restaurant seems broken into three main section; the covered patio; the booth bar area; the back section . Music blasting throughout; seems little diluted the back . If're looking spot'll able hear conversation though; may be best look elsewhere.When came time order I went the sausage gravy smothered chicken ($ 17) my friend got the croque madame ($ 18). The sausage gravy legit excellent . Large portion; well cooked; smothered amazing sauce it didn't disappoint in the slightest . I'd definitely recommend the dish you're looking something poultry based'll leave you both filled satisfied.Even though spot completely packed there the service wa just good the food!

Then the biscuit came . The biscuit the consistency a scone - flaky like you think a biscuit . That fine the biscuit the bottom; covered sauce chicken . The one top just dry . The chicken covered a``Nashville""hot sauce; to added heat not flavor . The chicken wa pretty moist . Again - an average chicken biscuit . My daughter said the same for hers . We just expected flavor . The pickle great . I wish the whole dish been good . Forget the side grit . I've never grit like in life . Very soupy (no surprise this time) not much flavor .

For main dish I ordered fried chicken biscuit mushroom gravy grit . The portion crazy huge yet the chicken somehow deliciously moist the inside . I not rave about the mushroom gravy tied the dish together . The biscuit definitely the sweeter side In't expecting .

And another thing this place that's amazing how fast food come . We placed order appetizer entree literally everything came five minute! I kid not; wa amazing! I can't wait come back here! Also I recommend the bread pudding it's heaven! The only down side; that found hair in our food couple time .: (Once in the restaurant then at home another dish .

714,7,"I used not think pickle great addition burger . Turns; I eating shit pickle . Dunno pickle an acidity cut like spicy knifen't overpower meat entree.My first visit try platter fried chicken smothered gravy; they cutely described``sandwich"". It's cute they put biscuit bottom top called sandwich . My ex-girlfriend called cheating``healthy exploration""... cute ;n't? Anywho; per protocol; scientific study start a baseline . The baseline their Honey Pickles; comparative 6 variation``Sandwich""section--I pride a fatass . The palette they were trying attempt a combination sweet spicy . The meal fall short heat prevails sweet . Sweet; like ex she let someone else her mouth.On second visit; friend decided order poutine pure lack restraint the word``cheese"". I scoffed his basicness soon a a mountain cheese fry slammed onto table the Southern God (waiter); soon scoffed . Then gave me those eye say ``'re mine tonight"". It a night pure terror . Much like best friend; the size impressive lacked the bravado back up . For intent purpose; a mountain fry; melted cheese; some bacon there.I my hand a the other``sandwich"". The``chicken; bacon; egg; cheese""a described...literally just a plate chicken; bacon; egg; and cheese . No shame playing it safe; risk; reward . The``bbq smothered""smothered a light bbq sauce . In a dish's inherently heavy; I thank for their mercy; I play win . The true winner the game; Winner Winner Chicken Dinner the``Mushroom Gravy Smothered Chicken"". To no surprise; true Southern fashion; the dish likely leave with a medical bill wa the tastiest . Fried chicken lathered in a gravy of the fried chicken of the plant kingdom (mushroom). This the perfect place to let date know the``real""and fried chicken obsession . And she can't handle at worst; she doen't deserve fried chicken.",5.0 star rating
715,7,This first time glad came . Had time rest party arrived host suggested wait the bar . Decided order mimosa no food .

718,7,Cons: place PACKED weekend ;'s hardly room move chair around ;'s loud.Pros: everything else...Jacob's Pickles quintessential brunch comfort food spot .

You also go greasy savory option like Poutine Mac n' Cheese.If're in evening ;n't pas dessert . It's a lot food; it be worth it . The Bread Pudding is insane . Look for seasonal special their Biscuits; French Toast; Bread Pudding . They offer seasonal flavor a the Sweet Potato/Pumpkin Confetti.Warning: the portion size huge order accordingly plan share . It's one those place huge portion mediocre quality food; however . The quality is top notch.,5.0 star rating

Itn't``BBQ smothered ;""a dry; fairly tasteless heap chicken; cheese; biscuit . It heavy fattening; not rich flavorful in the way I'd expect real Southern food.At $18-24 per dish; the price a bit steeper the quality merit; at least the portion generous enough somewhat justify them.In't impressed enough Jacob's Pickles warrant another visit .

748,7,"This our second visit Jacob's Pickles; time Sunday brunch . We rushed arrive 11:50am 30-40 minute wait; relatively short . We left ~1:45pm overheard wait 1-1.25 hour . It important know; general; portion size main plate large--typically; shareable! (One exception I found biscuit gravy & egg; I find right-sized single portion no leftover .) Part restaurant's vibe loud; especially main dining area bar located . The front extension back room little le loud . The seating combination communal table well table individual party . The first time visited; offered two seat table 4 others waiting ~30 minute; passed wait a different table the seating much (awkwardly) tight stranger . On second visit; we were offered a table 2 the back room a 40-minute wait.We the following: (1) Bloody B.L.T . cocktail: A Bloody Mary my default brunch drink . My impression that one spicy; achieved pepper rather Tabasco; without adding more saltiness--; plus me . The bacon jalapeno pickled egg wonderful addition! This Bloody Mary a slight sourness``pickled""taste first; I generally like (e.g .; I order a Bloody Mary nearby Sarabeth's too``pickly""); overwhelming . I ordered Bloody Mary both visit brunch . (2) Fried pickle: These 6 deep fried dill spear; the batter lighter fluffier; not heavy crunchy . The spicy red mayo not spicy is a good accompaniment the fried pickle . I liked fried pickle; 2-3 spear are enough me . I ready try starter future visit . (3) Biscuits gravy & egg: Very good sausage gravy biscuit relatively small piece sausage medium consistency gravy . This gravy is not the type that is peppery a kick . I love the two over-easy egg top! My criticism; is not insignificant; is that the gravy served hot steaming (not only slightly warm); this a problem both time I ordered for brunch . Nevertheless; I would order again the future . (But; would be ideal for them take the easy extra step to make the gravy perfect being hot .) (4) Croque madame: My partner ordered; it come a side home fry . I not try it; it looked substantial cheesy . He said it wa excellent open-faced version a traditional croque madame it work; especially with the fried chicken tender . (He enough leftover for another meal .) I a of the home fry; I thought the hearty piece were seasoned fried perfectly.I have posted some picture .

However; I eat; I want done right's they them at Jacob's pickles.We got deviled egg honey chicken pickle . For drink; I local Bronx Pilsner Julie L. Jam Jar.The Jam Jar a fun refreshing drink; a sure favorite strawberry lovers.The deviled egg came an insane amount yolk . Each half egg about 3 egg worth yolk piled top . Each order came 5 . The flavor spot; a bit tangy just salty enough . I probably have just eaten one saved rest we ended cleaning plate.The honey chicken pickle came crispy fried chicken slathered honey; piled atop two fluffy biscuit (cornbread?) topped a mound pickle . The meat juicy despite being white meat . The pickle lived the namesake this place; giving perfect reprieve to the heavier component this dish . The side grit came the dish great that wan't overly buttery it have lump in it.The price were reasonable; being $10-20; especially you consider that their portion size huge for Manhattan standard .

The Croque Madame come a lot cheese too much fry I believe . Talking too much; their Chicken & Pancake literally feed my whole birthday party .

Definitely way much a single person expect either share take something home . The syrup came both also delicious.Now; I wouldn't myself In't mention the drink . The BLT Bloody Mary a fun twist the classic . The Apple Pie Moonshine wa very strong had the medicinal taste moonshine first; the sweetness of apple pie tempered it down in the end . My favorite; though; wa the Jam Jar . In't even like gin based cocktail much wa perfect! Super rich jammy; I even ordered two . If love strawberry ;'ll love this; trust! I'd without a doubt come back the French toast and the Jam Jar; are the star the menu for me.,5.0 star rating

If I would've skipped one of these dish; the Coop platter; to just normal breakfast plate; albeit a tasty one . But a unique dish . We walked 11 a Sunday no reservation only to wait 25 minute seemed pretty reasonable considering crazy busy . The ambiance very nice; although the sound level pretty high . We seated the back at a long communal wooden table ;n't claustrophobic although we had group on side . Wen't the boozy option it seemed like many enjoying it around u . Service wa fast; friendly; competent . Overall; Jacob's an excellent brunch spot; both for the UWS; for Manhattan . A very solid choice a city replete excellent brunch option.,5.0 star rating
757,7,I came with group friend last week . Although I really wanted Chicken & Pancakes; group ordered; I decided BBQ Smothered Pepper Jack Chicken.Holy crap . Theyn't joking chicken smothered .

It incredibly rich everything could want a heavy brunch; which promptly fall a food coma will last rest the afternoon . The service always good; this restaurant is busy .

765,7,TL; DR: Arrive hungry; go weekday; bring group take six type pickle home ;n't bring friend talk softly loud.A friend Brooklyn told I needed go ;'s surprise's massive lineup weekend.Next time I go I need bring group pickle taste test . It tough choose one kind pickle (plus pickle came sandwich). Of course; also get pickle go own taste test.While yes; biscuit sandwich sort vaguely resemble sandwich; are huge . With grit . There no picking eating like sandwich . I'm sure someone; maybe; I'm one those people now cell phone too big type one hand; In't stand chance these sandwiches.In't proper Nashville hot chicken; I can't say this authentic not; I can tell that's delicious . The biscuit monstrous square thing designed sandwich perfect such . The bottom biscuit soaked hot sauce dense enough not turn mush; top still buttery perfect.The back mostly long communal table (table epic pickle sampling party) it very echoey loud . The sound control suboptimal; don't bring soft talking friend unless bring hearing aide . Sitting front patio probably better . The patio enclosed shoulder season ha heat lamp ;'ve got few patio week left yet . Or do your talking line focus food're inside.The ultimate test service is how handle something going wrong . Our server super friendly; happy answer our menu question help u make the best choice (oh god if we pick the second best brunch item? chaos!). When I got order there a piece mystery paper the plate . NBD; it's paper; I put it on the side busy optimizing brunch consumption.When came around check on u (help drink much coffee humanly possible) noticed the paper . I always up perk; the piece paper obviously no way hampered eating experience . I wa done eating this point; I'd reached the limit of body . I not arrived sufficiently hungry (I wa expecting a normal sandwich! In't do my research).Not did comp my sandwich; also made me a new one take me . They take brunch seriously . Maybe you'll wait a line; once you get inside they're going make sure everything is perfect.This place is worth waiting line for; planning your day you can skip the line.,5.0 star rating
766,7,The food good; service good; decor nice; there nothing spectacular . I expecting be wowed all glowing review it just ok experience; nothing particularly good bad . The portion very generous we shared bbq chicken biscuit sandwich good since bbq sauce in house made it didn't that traditional bbq color taste that wa a bit disappointing . We also biscuit fixing (biscuit corn based). I suggest going weeknight youn't a ridiculous wait time the weekend . If I can't think another place go in the UWS I would come back.,3.0 star rating
767,7,To kick Summer Friday; I friend I decided meet lunch Upper Best Side . Since sister restaurant Maison Pickles - cute name? - knew Jacob's Pickle's wouldn't disappoint.Walking no table available outside get table close enough front basically open air seating area . This venue fairly compact no one much room let tell; everyone make work if don't like hearing people hear conversation remember that this New York no one care that thing did last night . Anyway; amazing server prompt checking on u; providing water walking u menu . He suggested perfect summer drink: Jam Jar . This house infused strawberry farmer gin lemonade major Summer Friday vibe . If food hadn't filled u; trust I would've had much than one these..Since neither u wanted really break bank; we decided share two main: side penne style mac cheese along their sausage gravy buttermilk fried chicken . It literally one best food decision made 2018 . The mac cheese very creamy; cheesy AF everything could hope . The dish it come look small it packed what close an entire box pasta . Meanwhile; chicken drowned sausage gravy every bite wa just comforting delicious especially you pop couple piece the mac cheese . Have say; the mac cheese hit the spot than the chicken point the chicken dish being large - definitely a friendly place those a bottomless stomach just absolutely starving fresh food! Overall; the food; service drink option bomb . The layout the venue narrow it get loud sit closer the front you have a good conversation plenty natural light for those Yelp photo . Definitely going to come back soon to check the rest the food drink option!,5.0 star rating

781,7,Jacob's Pickles one those place wonder's really worth hype.. especially're scared away hearing 1 hour+ wait location pretty far popular brunch/lunch spot city; when come here.. be fully committed waiting unless're going trek downtown . I travelled almost 2.5 hour weekend (damn MTA!) quoted 1.5 hour wait after experience here.. I WOULD GLADLY DO IT AGAIN.Okay ;'s little misleading since friend get before time I arrived; seated within 10 minute . (Pro tip: Run late have friend put their name wait commute; LOLjk!!) But; waiting system kind nice since get text walk around neighborhood . On Sunday; parking fairly difficult find although street parking available; In't think it's most convenient option . Okay--first thing first; have know one entree literally feed two people you small-moderate eater like I . When you sit; you can't help stare what people having presentation AMAZING it look delicious you want have everything're eating (yes; one those place!!) restaurant look small the front; there plenty seating the back's well lit place just ha overall great ambiance.One small con the table relatively close each other so space a little tight; plus table not separated others.. instead many group people sit along one large; long table . Thisn't a huge deal me.We started the deviled egg EXTREMELY creamy delicious . I would recommend these however In't overall recommend getting appetizer since the portion huge and you really need the room your entree . I the honey glazed chicken; friend the mushroom gravy chicken & type chicken a skillet . All these were excellent though I'd have recommend the mushroom gravy chicken the most . They give you two large piece chicken that are SO SOFT; cooked PERFECTION!! The skin also amazingly crispy; the honey one had the perfect amount honey drizzle the mushroom gravy RIDICULOUSLY FLAVOURFUL; like oh god!! I need to have this again.Overall; I JUST NEED TO COME BACK HERE AND TRY EVERYTHING ON THE MENU . 10/10 highly recommend . Service okay ;n't bad or good but In't care THE FOOD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.,5.0 star rating

In NYC fashion; table 12 inch two table either side; even other guest friendly eager talk about food they ordered.Having come big dinner serious drinking previous night; felt ordering breakfast what our body craved even though at lunchtime.Bacon Egg & Cheese Biscuit Sandwich (two fried egg; 2 year aged Vermont cheddar; sterling bacon) order of the Croque Madame (Buttermilk Fried Chicken; Sliced Black Forest Ham; Gruyere Cheese; Sunny-Side Up Eggs a Bacon Egg Cheese biscuit Served Home Fries) the two dish decided share.Both exceptional...the biscuit pillow soft; the egg were perfectly cooked; the fried chicken moist...overall the food simply incredible .

793,7,I came dinner damn dark . Ok; I understand whole thing ambiance you know; I'd like somewhat see I eating least able find fork . It seems brunch may better option . I'm giving 3 star aside darkness; really space . We seated long table shared other guest . I'm find that; when I only an inch away another person I know eating dinner; is difficult be comfortable our arm accidentally touching . The poor gal corner end literally their chair way past table side . On top that; plate huge so there really is no space . Honestly; I'd rather wait bit be forced seated a tiny space . Aside the much need structural change this place; I think the food somewhat good . The Tennessee Hot Chicken delicious had enough a kick . However; turkey leg plain not exciting . It's like roasted without seasoning . Maybe I judgmental turkey leg theme park so oddly satisfying . We also tried the root beer pretty good . I like the cream one . Although ;'s not that special considering I just buy a bottle these cream soda a quarter the price.I may come back; for brunch; just see's different . Also; despite so cramped; I could barely hear anything decided blast the music . I mean it wa good music; I just find it strange a dinner setting . It's like they tried to make it a bar/club at dinner.,3.0 star rating

Perfectly grilled; skillfully seasoned; beautifully accompanied yummy mini side...Yet; octopus tough . You could barely cut knife . A costly mistake.Wagyu truffle burger (KOW Wagyu blend; truffle dijonnaise; caramelized onion; aged gruyere & shaved black truffle): good bad . Bad; I told truffle add burger (reason I ordered) moment served to (could mentioned before bringing). Good; they offered to charge u (In't even ask); wa professional them . Duck confit: the meat wa tender flavorful; with plenty side . Chocolate mousse: good . Overall; although enjoyed visit; mistake prevent me giving place that 4 star ('s a 3.75 star). The food high low; although portion big; thought price were a bit high for the quality of the dish selected.In addition; were constantly breathing smoke the kitchen .

803,8,This review 2019 Winter Restaurant Week experience.The RW menu exclusive limited option . We compared regular lunch menu realized we'd probably save money we order same thing main dish regular lunch menu; my friend . I; however; decided go RW menu since supposed be chef's recommendations.I kinda regretted.The portion really generous compared many other restaurant . Flavor wise; okay . They flavorful; yet I'd say were even bit salty . The reason I regretted lack real value . The Seared Salmon I chose only $14 regular lunch menu . Although none the RW salad are on the regular menu; I doubt they worth $12 (all the regular salad; the most expensive $13 the average around $10). Honestly; the salad great all . The arugula salad I chose just plate arugula; nothing; nothing le . We have ordered salad the regular menu and something else; would satisfy stomach well cost le . Service a bit slow; they were attentive (refilling water; cleaning plate; getting bread u; etc.). Ambience nice; . But one thing really surprised wa; a well reputed restaurant; butter the complementary bread wa still hard served . We literally to cut with quite straighten . I think I may come back for lunch brunch; I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND RW lunch . It's not worthy the money.,3.0 star rating

HahTHE FOOD IS AMAZING . Seriously . So delicious; presented really well; I would eat again again . And AGAIN . Calamari ($ 19): one best calamari I've; ever . Every time I eat calamari this place; get compared Boucherie . They a little tinier average place; every bite juicy; crispy; full flavor . By time I reached the end the plate; maybe 15 minute later; still hot crispy! No sogginess detected; tyvm . At the moment; I alson't see menu anymore I'm pretty bummed that . . .Confit duck ($ 39): first time this I wa blown . It a little the greasy side the crispy skin; is the salad on the bottom/around the duck try offset; wa so deliciously tender flavorful . I really wish it wa polite eat it chicken-wing style like I at Popeyes though: (Steak frites ($ 49): THE BEST STEAK AND FRIES WITH THE MOST AMAZING SAUCE EVER . I seriously loved the steak - cooked perfectly; so juicy; so delicious combined the sauce . And the sauce! If only they gave more! I could've easily a whole cup of that!

Our table split two desert Chocolate Mousse the Creme Brullet . Both generously covered whipped cream strawberry . They could no wrong this evening; a both rich flavor taste . It hit the spot :).The service the entire night wa on point . When I needed a drink the waiter wa close-by; despite getting busier closer 7 pm the food came in a more reasonable period.Look: it's not a cheap place any mean .

836,8,I came girlfriend Thursday night decided sit outside since weather still nice . We greeted quickly waitress presented drink food menu . We ordered cocktail start took few minute decide what eat.We ordered foie gras start; then bouillabaisse (mixed seafood saffron broth) 40 oz tomahawk rib-eye share . (yes going since celebrating reunion seeing) They brought cocktail basket bread first unfortunately immediately send back bread . At firstn't sure were seeing correctly; MOLD french bread brought u . Honestly the first time I've ever seen at restaurant (my knowledge). I forgot take picture I think were shock quickly waved someone take back they were apologetic'm sure also embarrassed brought new bread u . But already kind set a negative mood the rest our food came . When our foie gras came out (the bread) inspected every single piece carefully's super super obvious unless happen see the small spec . The foie gras very good; rich normally so In't able eat much it . The seafood soup also very flavorful; I would definitely recommend trying . Finally; the 40oz tomahawk rib-eye . First all; it wa HUGE . I think with the amount food already ordered; it could fed three u lady just order one le app entree next time you want this steak . The steak wa good; cooked medium rare like we asked but wa a few piece were pretty fatty we had to cut around the meat . All all; term service the rest the entree besides the moldy bread; it wa a pleasant experience (I would probably given 4 star it wan't the mold) But we found mold in the house bread; I'm sure I would come back to this location I can't give a higher rating . They need to a better process inspecting food accurately . It's not just stale bread; wa MOLD it and it could have very well gotten people sick . And we were served moldy bread; i'm sure there were other customer served moldy bread night.,2.0 star rating
837,8,My friend texted :'ll restaurant weekRestaurant Week an inside joke u .

So it lost either u I made reservation Boucherie seeing Restaurant Week menu . And even though had attractive 3-course ($ 42) Restaurant Week offering? Yeah; one those thing listed happened . It sweltering outside I opted something far lighter 3 course meat: Salade Nicoise ($ 27) featuring seared Ahi perfect . The Boucherie Burger ($ 28) fry equally perfect before go shock sticker price know it wa made blend dry-aged Pat LaFrieda beef; top-flight purveyor whom Boucherie source their meat . Truth told; is meat place . They even a whole separate menu red meat offering looked amazing though this night; amazing enough circumvent desire a light meal . The French Bistro menu is similar to that at Balthazar though Balthazar win buzzy atmosphere - I imagine - Boucherie win meat . Aside an awning that looked a little much like low-market California chain Boulange; I thought Boucherie a very nice job . Meat my next visit; perhaps during Winter Restaurant Week.,4.0 star rating

My partner ordered French toast great; again; maybe expectation too high; bread Balthazar'd expect . The kicker; however; the cheap; imitation maple; colored corn syrup that they served with it...it wan't even good imitation standard . I'm sorry; at $22 (when the menu clearly state``mixed berry maple syrup"") actual maple syrup should be served.Go for the charm scene; not the cuisine.",3.0 star rating

Instead; recommend pairing bite steak the bone marrow; incredibly buttery melt mouth . Beware letting sit too long though; it'll start coagulate.Desserts: Pistachio Bombe Glacee - Great way end the meal . You basically get warm cake cool ice cream one . And get have chocolate pistachio vanilla flavor one . For some reason; we liked dessert more the Flatiron location; it may have just luck the draw . The chocolate poured the dessert seemed have thicker hardened better the little dessert dome.Chocolate Mousse - Pretty standard classic . Can't really go wrong.Drinks: Lillet Spritz - Bubbly refreshing . Kind I wish frosé would make feel; always fall short of.Yamazaki 12-Year-Old Japanese Whisky - This potent an amazing drink sip at throughout your meal . Every sip is a deep warmth you can feel the way your lip the center your chest.Some hiccup in service: When we first arrived; we stood around quite awhile anybody noticed we came seat us.We ordered a ginger ale had speak 3 different people it brought over.Otherwise; service attentive and checked in on how we were doing.,4.0 star rating

For appetizer; we foie gras steak tartare; delicious . Foie gras made terrine (instead seared). On side were thin layered bread went foie gras not overbearing taste . Steak tartare; much my surprise; savory despite nearly raw . Daintily seared outside; mix red brown made dish looked appetizing . Raw quail egg top also helped balance could-have-been bare meat . Both appetizer were five star here.Main course good well . We rack lamb 16 oz NY steak . Unlike American lamb are cut individual rack seared both side sauce; the rack lamb were cooked whole cut individual . While the taste more blend what I used; provided different type experience . NY steak came medium rare; exactly requested . The meat tender easy cut along the texture . Taste a tint sweetness first followed immediately a warming mix salt-seared richness . Main course good; perhaps the restaurant occupied; the dish the plate were slightly cold the time arrived . This perhaps would the one suggestion I would give any . Finally the dessert impeccable . We asked raspberry sorbet the Yelp photo multi-colored pink sorbet looked marvelous . Not shocking; the sorbet fresh; light; easily melted upon eating . I can't describe the blissful taste well recommending anyone's interested try it yourself! The dessert perhaps our favorite part of the meal.Before ending the note; I also want add the service wa good .

An eighth an inch the outer part semi crisp cooked well; the rest the center all med-rare; bravo . We finished the meal a dessert; creme brûlée . From the look run the mill; once dug found massive amount ground vanilla bean gave the dish a good pop . The service time around wa attentive; not rushed; and fast .

I went Wildflower (St George Vert Absinthe; Hendrinks Gin; Watermelon Juice; Lavender Syrup; Lemon & Egg White) my friend went their Old Fashioned . My drink refreshing; delicious; beautiful . Perfect a sunny day window open spring chilly air . Appetizers - We split mussel escargot . The mussel great broth delicious . They brought complimentary bread sop all marinated eggplant sundried tomato spread . The escargot a little overdone . Nice buttery come bubbling hot . By time done simmering slightly charred taste instead melting away butter . Entrees - We ordered two different kind steak . My friend been guided through the process . She went the Steak Frites Au Poivre come a delicious peppercorn gravy I went the filet de Boeuf come wilted spinach . The quality the meat top notch . Unfortunately steak really way over-cooked . We ordered medium-rare the rarer side . My friend noted wanted reddish-pink; definitely go rare medium . Both steak came on the grey-ish side . They still tasted phenomenal executed the right temperature would have been 5 star good . The french fry were really delicious crisp loved peppercorn cream sauce . Desert a bit a mishap communication . They bring the desert menu early our steak arrived that's nitpicking away much . We ordered the pistachio bomb glacee split . Absolutely delicious . The ball pistachio gelato covered with a thick fudge layer rich chocolate on top of a thin fudge brownie layer . The server pours this out onto the ball of ice cream . However; we asked if he could wait two second so my friend could adjust camera setting photograph pouring it over slowly . He started pour after she asked to wait just a moment then she asked to stop he started laughing smiling her continuing to pour . It wa a slightly weird moment . But I enjoyed the ice cream even though awesome photo opportunity went missed . All around were plus minus to the dining experience .

876,8,I came on invitation manager a follow sister restaurant Olio e Piú . It a much larger restaurant former inside architecture beautiful.We treated graciously staff two appetizer; two drink; two entree; opted only go 1 desert end . I enjoyed Boucherie Sazerac a sweet liquorish like absinthe cocktail . My girlfriend opted Gewurztraminer a lightly sweet white wine.For starter opted mussel steak tartare . The mussel fresh sauce a sweet white wine went well the crispy baguette slices.The steak tartare delicious well balanced spice fresh onion . Our main dish the rack lamb the filet mignon truffle butter . At first glance the rack lamb beautifully presented the color balanced well the spinach green tomato . My suggestion get the filet medium rare even rare anything well done tend dry the meat I could feel the end starting dry . As any large cut meat is going pan seared.For desert we went the pistachio bombe glacee; rich creamy chocolate over . Overall experience great . Our server left girlfriend a gift the restaurant depicts the work Boucherie does.Will definitely coming back.If I suggest anything the restaurant to improve to take to the next level . Our primary server wa fantastic; did seem like were people trying to take order well may make thing unorganized . At the other high luxury restaurant I've to I've enjoyed the personal interaction your server your host .

The elegant greenhouse aesthetic paired equally impressive service food definitely make perfect recipe celebrating special occasion way; even made reservation father-in-law's upcoming birthday! For dinner; husband I ordered: + Saute de ri de veau aux morilles ($ 26) aka veal sweet bread mushroom galore - I'm the adventurous eater I hesitant try sweet bread (thymus gland) my husband wanted try I'm obsessed mushroom . Honestly; I little nibble the sweet bread; actually tame (funny texture taste); I still mostly ate the mushroom . However; decided favorite dish the night both loved the flavor uniqueness the dish! + Moules mariniere ($ 23) aka mussel - We generally order mussel whenever wherever's offered an appetizer . These not particularly notable still delicious . The broth more flavorful average the mussel-plumpness only average.+ Lotte rotie aux coques ($ 37) aka monkfish - I'd heard the past monkfish``poor man's lobster""although I'd; I never quite understood the comparison Boucherie . This truly delicious dish--the broth flavorful (I found surprisingly familiar reminded Chinese cuisine little) the monkfish akin a tender lobster! + Filet de boeuf ($ 52) aka filet mignon truffle butter - I ordered per the chef's recommendation--medium--cooked perfectly . + Creme brulee - Actually; might've my favorite dish the night . It literally the most perfect creme brulee I've ever had . The caramelized top wa strong enough when tapped gently it didn't break; when actually dug; it wa so delicate tasting--did do? The inside wa also perfection chock fill of tiny vanilla bean dot (there a technical term the dot?) and the berry the perfect complement.There so many thing on the menu I can't wait try and I'm sure I'll many dish update review after we dine for my father-in-law's birthday!",5.0 star rating

I would also recommend order steak medium rare .) What I really liked these dish that unlike restaurant; nothing overly salty; I not feel the need drink ton water . My sister I ended the meal a crème brûlée; come topped fresh slice strawberry . Although wa decently sized (quite full); this crème brûlée wa very light not sweet . It a very nice texture; the custard the sugar crust . I'm definitely glad we went with the crème brûlée .

I didn't really enjoy charred piece end skipped but the middle piece were a perfect medium rare; not too chewy still bloody . Bone marrow very rich difficult finish . Might been good mix the meat the bone marrow . Dessertpistachio bombe glacee - unique presentation . Chocolate easily overpowers the pistachio eat the pistachio ice cream alone you want flavor .

The caesar salad good lacked punch flavor homemade caesar dressing put it over top . The holy grail caesar salad at MASH london thats different review...We tried steak . My wife ordered filet I ordered $65 steak I forget type . My steak bitter charred/burnt taste outside overwhelmed whole steak . It top 5 worst I had . The filet wa edible it wa overcooked based order (medium) not greatest . For our side had potato gratin wa bland . It needed salt some flavor . The potato cooked right missed flavor department.We had the creme brulee had good flavor the true test creme brulee the top it be caramelized the point it make a sound you tap it with a spoon . This lacked type caramelization so the texture melted together . Not the best.Overall; the price and the high yelp review place missed the mark BIG TIME . It no than a 2 star based on my experience .

Salad veggie fresh; dressing a little tart my taste . In't think the salad tasted united mixing that make sense.Overall; I thought Ipanema Restaurant an average experience .

I reallyn't need much make happy; this felt like the laziest side salad I've ever . Genuinely; wa complete thought . While there wan't upcharge a side salad (would been far; far issue); the least could the chef not least put a couple of olive? Maybe a few piece of cheese? Some nut; slightly dressing?

Service be bit slow time; especially order drink . But waiter extremely friendly accommodating . I ordered Bitoque time I've been here tasted exactly same . The Bitoque classic dish steak topped an overeasy egg round fry side . There's a generous portion beer garlic sauce dish . Unfortunately; steak a bit closer medium medium rare . I would probably order it rare next time . Also; house hot sauce extremely spicy could bring you tear you're used the heat.Overall; I enjoyed my experience here and would come back to try the other dish just get the Bitoque.,4.0 star rating

Nothing beat hearty piece steak potato fry fried egg layered garlic sauce . However; I wan't accustomed the fancy cylinder-shaped fry; since I usually get my Bitoque steak fry regular fry . The Vatapa; is a seafood stew shrimp monkfish drenched a coconut milk based sauce grounded nut; be disappointing . I found the fish the shrimp be overcooked the sauce a too sweet me .

974,10,If I could base dining experience solely food would easily five star . The complimentary breadstick hot delicious . The artichoke/avocado toast amazing . Our fresh pasta sure tastiest I've long time . Where I found Aunt Jake's really need step service . From host bar table service; need help . Looks like service; mostly millennial crowd ;n't deterrent big issue . When arrived were told were running behind reservation could take seat bar . No big deal when get shown table upstairs half table were empty . If way getting u buy drink kind silly; definitely would've ordered one table . We sat at the bar there one bartender the bar table . Although promptly greeted u gave u cocktail menu it would another ten minute came back serve u . When the host came tell u table ready asked add drink the table bill could do . To get the bartender attention pay tab a hassle another ten minute wait he continued make drink table ignore u . Once were seated upstairs waiter greeted u a carafe of water . Good thing the carafe getting attention drink impossible . Actually getting attention anything wa impossible . After taking order he pretty much disappeared . Not during meal did our waiter any staff check u . When were done had flag our waiter for our check told Wi-Fi wa down we couldn't pay credit card . Luckily we had cash who know long we'd waiting . It would've nice for our waiter to at the very least let u know wa going . If decide to go; make a reservation . The space very small the restaurant very popular .

976,10,Overall I would rate Aunt Jake's 3.5/4 . Coming restaurant dinner; I fairly high expectation especially since lot people I spoke great thing say really enjoyed food . The reason I would rate Aunt Jakes lower side because their service . I 6pm reservation showed around 20 minute early . Upon arrival; I directed wait bar guest's arrival - is fair I no problem waiting . After around 10-15 minute sitting bar; I not approached nor I asked I wanted drink . I finally given menu glass water time; my guest had already arrived seated table . At table; greeted by waitress super upbeat positive . I really loved energy how friendly . She handed u our menu gave u few minute look over . When came back; asked more information bespoke cocktail - essentially cocktail allows select choice an alcoholic base; type ingredient'd like add type sweetness/sourness level; etc .'d like your drink be . We decided get drinkn't really sure combo include instead; described kind drink typically skew towards . Our waitress really nailed our drink order so impressed . Another downfall our visit wa noticed all the table received breadstick unfortunately; were forgotten . The food definitely made faults.For food; we ordered the chicken Parmesan (come two piece chicken cutlet no pasta) the squid ink pasta garlic sauce . Flavors were on point and we were very impressed the flavor combo . We really enjoyed the food this spot service improve bit.Something that we also noticed wa that the two table the front the restaurant not ideal location the winter time . Whenever a new person arrives; the customer sitting at hit a gust cold air . Yes are heater right u itn't help there's a continuous flow people walking and . Considering we were one the first party to arrive for dinner; the maitre'd could done a better job seating arrangement.,4.0 star rating

979,10,Aunt Jake's fun pasta dinner experience Little Italy Saturday night . However; cost experience; restaurant get le full mark . For food drink; ordered bottle white wine (whatever cheapest bottle $40) pretty decent . I'll first admit In't sophisticated wine palate I really enjoyed - too sweet oaky . We also got calamari share - basically tasted like delicious fried nibble not much (isn't necessarily bad thing youn't like squid). Next; pasta course our main . I had the cavatelli marinara . It bit underwhelming; the sauce fairly bland . I say a generous portion size; I'll slightly bland pasta lunch tomorrow . The service okay . The host open the fact they pretty late seating table then (curtly) directed u the bar; board people already standing increasingly annoyed waiter trying get with plate plate food . The service at our table wa fine - nothing terrible amazing . As ambiance; is a two level restaurant we the top level . I can't speak the first level; ours wa extraordinarily loud pretty tight - two quality made a le optimal dining experience.Maybe try restaurant on a quieter weeknight order a more flavorful dish enjoy Aunt Jake's the fullest extent.,3.0 star rating

I'm glad I made reservation least week before.If I describe food Aunt Jake's; one word; would``smooth .""Weird; I know ;'s just texture . It's almost like everything made well's coarse haphazard . Here's ate: Breadsticks :'re complimentary . They're crisp outside soft almost like soft pretzel . There's good flavor them without overly salty not dry . The outside almost seemed buttery I'm sure's brushed some olive oil . Meatballs : 3 medium-large ball an order . These soft good tomato sauce . Of course we found dipping bread leftover sauce.Spaghetti Sunday sauce: I knew I wanted Sunday sauce couldn't think better long pasta go spaghetti . When arrived; the first pasta I bit it made happy . However; you've eaten pasta dish; Sunday sauce going feel bland . It's still a good sauce it own.Tagliatelle Lamb Ragu: typically I see lamb a red sauce we intrigued a white; creamy sauce . It's very rich be forewarned any cream sauce be . My husband said favorite sauce we agreed it probably be paired a somewhat chewier pasta . Black ink fettuccini vongole: our sever brought over; said``this one the best""gave a small smile . This probably favorite the night . The sauce wa garlicky; some heat it since it sits the bottom the bowl; I recommend getting to the pasta the bottom first . The restaurant small the entrance from a basement door I a bit trouble finding it at first Google map . The service wa ok the restaurant loud especially near the bar area .

990,10,Came work team outing food great experience subpar . Upon initially entering restaurant extremely tight small . My group made way bar ordered cocktail menu well ordered mojito Moscow mule; thourougly enjoyed . We then led upstairs where would dining . There one group quite awkwardly quiet due there music . We asked could put music's told WiFi out; so therefore music too . Our server quite friendly patient ordered appetizer . We opted calarmi; burrata; meatball . The first weird thing; WiFi could serve single portion each appetizer (make no sense- went .) When time came order all went pasta (squid ink fettuccine; cavatelli; ravioli etc) everyone loved meal! Now come part why I knocked star . When the bill came bos put corporate credit card down treating u . Then are told can pay card due the WiFi cut consequently the card machine down........? They basically demanding use Apple Pay the only solution problem that clearly no one's the restaurant . After tried explain this corporate card that paying quite simplyn't given another option . After much waiting; the manager/partner; Anthony; come explains the situation yet u . Although apologeticn't offering compensation; any solution HIS problem than pay Apple Pay . My bos attempted add corporate card onto Apple Pay the manager watched she it it simply would work . We finally came the solution him taking picture our CC will charge u tomorrow (we were concerned because do we know's going steal the credit card number his answer simply``integrity . ``) Now I 100% understand unexpected thing happen; especially because I worked a customer service food industry job 7 year this wa unacceptable . The restaurant have shut door the night and let u know beforehand this problem; we were faced one option paying . I'm sure how others android payed their meal the manager wa not budging how we can pay for our meal . Although everyone the restaurant wa apologetic; it just wan't right them have the customer feel like only one way pay than cash.The food wa great indeed; I wouldn't go back due to the way we were treated . BTW they have one gluten free pasta!,3.0 star rating

But I miss the warm the slightly casual vibe the old Aunt Jake's.We got the rigatoni Sunday sauce Squid Ink Fettuccine Broken meatball sauce . The sauce ariabatta based sauce different meat both liked sauce the rigatoni very doughy tough . My fettuccine perfectly cooked the broken meatball slightly cold.. (eeek) The service very sub par . We ask twice complimentary bread sticks- should've arrived their . Whenever have dined good/true Italian restaurant; s always ample complimentary bread start; one would get second need . But; felt highly conscious to ask our bread basket (twice too) not like we would mind paying; if it is complimentary then why make a big deal it? Anyway; our whole experience got dulled this unnecessary bread-basket experience sub-par pasta dish to top.,3.0 star rating

My friend I sat outside back patio string light; ambience great . The reason I giving 3 star because food okay service not.Food - I ordered squid ink fettuccini flavorn't there . I huge fan pasta Italian foodn't anything special I took first couple bite . My friend I shared plate agreed only alright.Drinks - the drink good though; you can't really go wrong drink . We got the sangria; moscato; the frozay two thumb up.Service - is our experience plummeted . Our server rarely ever smiled; not happy asking recommendation; rarely checked u wanted refill our water . Itn't busy dinner day either we surprised the lack service we got . Also; our server wa taking the order the table next ours; made snarky comment u saying something our bottled drink we brought outside . Yes; we did bring drink outside we set it aside we going finish later . Just hearing the server say it purposely loud enough u hear made u want get leave.Overall; it isn't bad restaurant it seems like it is a popular restaurant try . Guess friend and I the outlier not such a great experience.,3.0 star rating
1005,10,Great place midst busy little Italy . I love you choose type pasta what sauce go . We came pretty early Friday night without reservation got seated right away . Our waitress super friendly nice.The breadstick give amazing; hot garlicy . The calamari okay; best I but pretty solid calamari; liked the spicy kick the marinara sauce the pepper come the calamari.I the chicken parmigiana; HUGE portion enough feed two people my opinion; barely ate half it . Lots cheese it the chickenn't dry; the marinara this spicy; loved it . The spaghetti definitely tasted like fresh pasta little bit rough the texture; thicker your usual the barilla box; cooked al dente; this the Sunday sauce is tomato sauce veal; sausage; something like a short rib? This yummy . All all really enjoyed Aunt Jakes; definitely back try everything else well their drink look pretty good.,4.0 star rating

1010,10,We came late dinner Sunday . We visiting NYC Chicago . Loved atmosphere; neighborhood restaurant entry structure . Would say service pretty lacking however . We very hungry ordered 2 appetizer pretty immediately seated 8:30pm . The appetizer showed at same time main pasta dish hour later . The restaurant not overly crowded; this little disappointing . Calamari a bit dry over fried . Kale Caesar Salad enjoyable . We also first told were Sunday sauce first selected; were later told weren't . The sauce a lot sausage; a minimal amount short rib . Had ask a couple time a bottle Peligrino I ordered . Similar another reviewer; also thought music being played pretty goofy out place for this establishment . This most likely our only Little Italy Italian dinner stop of this trip; wish delivered a little better.,2.0 star rating
1011,10,Food wonderful ;'re getting 3-star rating they ran meatball! I came friend Tuesday night . We reservation 7 pm; arrive restaurantn't crowded . We promptly seated were given water breadstick start (breadstick super good btw!). We came this place specifically looking order meatball . We planned order meatball appetizer & I going order broken meatball sauce . As began place order; waiter informed u they run meatball were waiting a delivery . Once delivered however; they would take another 3-4 hour cook; therefore couldn't order meatball appetizer broken meatball sauce . Seriously???!! What kind of Italian restaurant run of meatball? And a Tuesday night when it's even crowded all? What kind of planning is that? Needless say were super disappointed; had reconsider entire order . That sole reason had wanted come ala had now pick something new eat . We settled Branzino; squid ink fettuccine the Puttanesca sauce; the cavatelli the Arabiatta sauce . The Branzino really well cooked--crispy buttery the outside a soft interior . The cavatelli arabiatta sauce the definite standout but the squid ink pasta good . They give pretty large portion; you're able bring home lunch the next day.That said; still left a little dissatisfied not able have the meatball . So you come; prepared with a backup order case the meatball suddenly run again lol!,3.0 star rating

1020,10,Came Saturday night reservation; ended waiting 45 minute be seated . The host offered u drink house makeup wait time; helped time pas much faster . After seating; waited another 10-15 minute waiter came take order . So whole getting food trying get someone's attention pretty impossible . BUT! The food absolutely delicious! I actually came back another time first dine experience.Burrata stracciatella $14: offer single portion sharing portion item menu . We wanted try variety dish we got single portion . It actually huge . In't think one person finish all that eat another entree . The portion big enough share 3 people . The dish refreshing; opened stomach being hungry an hour . Mussels $14 :; big portion a single person serving! The mussel fresh; doen't old seafood aftertaste . It well marinated the sauce; recommend! Squid ink fettuccine vongole $23: delicious! They generous the clam; the white wine sauce went perfectly the pasta . Again; big portion a single serving size . Branzino $23: favorite . The fish cooked perfectly the flavor excellent . Four cheese herb ravioli $18: I'll pas . It way salty; the pasta cold the time reached our table . We also ordered the red sangria good .

Another 20 min later; table next u finally got food and then got food that . No apologizes; nothing . And asked``wa everything ``...speechless,1.0 star rating
1022,10,I came friend's birthday very underwhelming experience overall . The reservation: My friend made reservation 7PM requested outdoor seating . We got 7 tablen't ready 7; big deal since hung around bar bit . After 15 minute; proceeded tell u people outside leaving anytime soon; table inside . Again; big deal since outdoor seating not guaranteed everything point understandable . The menu: After drink came; server came around take order . Itn't now server let u know good chunk menu unavailable (pesto sauce; gnocchi; tiramisu; beef carpaccio; couple item In't remember). Some u originally picked dish just learned unavailable; ask an extra couple minute look menu decide another dish . I thought strange server not tell u many missing thing the menu we got fully settled drink order already placed . The food: Burrata: This dish the only good dish I tried . It very flavorful not heavy the bread perfectly toasted . A must try you ever find here! Fettuccine Nero Vongole (little neck clam; garlic; white wine; butter; chili) $22: Fettucini vongole a white wine sauce one favorite Italian dish probably my go-to dish every time; I completely disappointed dish . I saw a couple slice garlic literally 5 piece chili flake mixed the pasta; overall flavorless . The lack a flavorful sauce (the fact little sauce) made a completely bland dish . The worst part the sandiness . I never had a pasta+clam dish sandy this one . There sand every bite; making very difficult extremely unpleasant eat . Stay away this dish! I also tried a bite my friend's rigatoni lamb ragu . It more flavorful my dish; still a bit bland my opinion . Breadsticks: These decent a mild garlic-y taste . The menu say first basket breadstick free and additional order $2.50 ;n't ask u we wanted refill and just kept bringing u refill . Wen't charged the bill the refill even though the bill indicate the number time refilled the basket . Confused; whatevs . Tiramisu: We told the server friend's birthday; brought a tiramisu with a candle her I thought very strange since had told un't tiramisu day??? Another thing wa a bit annoying wa he didn't tell u the birthday surprise wa $7 . Definitely not a big deal since we were there celebrate our friend; other place I've would least give u a warning a birthday treat not free bringing out . I hoping this experience wa an anomaly considering we overheard they had JUST moved this new location (just next door to the old location) that day so maybe they were still trying to get used to everything the new location . I probably not back considering there are so many other choice for Italian food the city; open to giving it another try people more pleasant experience the future.,2.0 star rating
1023,10,I wannaeat pasta until kill . So bomb.Came Sunday night got nice table back . Service on slower side; space so nice drink so good didn't mind.The food legit . Nothing ordered short delicious . Even free bread stick addicting.We started burrata; the family size enough the 4 u . If didn't ton pasta coming way def would've polished off we playing the long game.Pastas perfect . My fav the sunday sauce; had sausage short rib it . It so good I can't even think it because it make salivate . Lasagna a close second fav; HUGE serving; super cheesy; need I say more? The carbonara vodka both bomb well; out-shined the sunday sauce lasagna . As drink we tried a variety the cocktail; all were good . I really liked take on an aperol spritz.I'll def back to sample the remaining pasta; also to more sunday sauce!,5.0 star rating
1024,10,Heard lot good thing place friend; I quite excited try out . While meal bad; price I not think place met expectation . We able get reservation an early dinner Friday . Although little 6; place absolutely packed moment got . I really liked menu left lot option customization standpoint . The pasta portion menu mainly list pasta; separate list sauce . Since first time; decided order two pasta an appetizer split chicken parm . Way much food two people; figured could take home . For pasta rigatoni vodka sauce ravioli arabbiata . The rigatoni pasta extremely good . Tasted very fresh perfectly cooked . Unfortunately; the vodka sauce lackluster . Simply put; the sauce lacked flavor . The little flavor did tasted akin a marinara sauce a vodka sauce . As a whole; this dish really missed the mark me.The ravioli pasta quite good . The piece huge a pretty generous portion cheese well . The arabbiata sauce also pretty good . Not overly spicy certainly packed a lot flavor had a bit a kick . This definitely favorite the two pasta . The chicken parm wa decent; however I wouldn't say's a standout among the many chicken parms I had the city . The one thing I really liked wa the sauce wa sort a spicy marinara (could even been their arabbiata sauce) gave it a little bit extra term flavor . As a whole; I would not say my first experience wa overly negative . However; I did not experience the quality food I expected given their very good reputation.,3.0 star rating

But no; actually ignored u and the entire situation.The saving grace server Javier . He checked u often our regular server (n't know name) and saved the situation pointing what happening the manager . Eventually; our waitress stopped attending u without reason and Javier said he would take care u; which I wa grateful.We gave Javier a good tip and thanked attentiveness . At least Aunt Jakes one good server . Aunt Jakes good food we probably come back; the service demonstrated today wa truly horrendous . We grateful the comped meal and apology the manager; this truly can't happen or will lose customer . I overheard the manager giving comped meal to two other table had waited long for food .

I about 2 week). For dinner; I the farfalle marinara sauce . My fiance the chicken parm . SO good . I wa about lick my plate clean; figured might frowned upon in such a fine establishment .

1030,10,By far worst service I've ever experienced Manhattan (anywhere) matter . My group 5 came Saturday evening an 845 reservation . We could tell restaurant overbooked running extremely behind there significant line entrance near bar area . We winded sitting ~45 min late . The host/manager gave u free round red wine long wait...least acknowledged! When sat right top entrance; squeezed 5 ppl 4 person table . Thisn't a huge deal; fact a curtain cold air entrance blowing face entire time ridiculous . Our waitress took well 30 min bring drink never brought bread we flagged asking than . Our entree winded coming 2 hr reservation 1045pm . Although starving we came; our appetiten't mood eat a heavy Italian dinner close 11pm . We ordered two apps came before entree...family meatball kale salad . Dressing on salad quite tasty the kale way crunchy . The meatball tasted good going down the sauce decent; literally could enjoyed eating my finger that point . When the entree came; one my friend dish completely cooked (shrimp scampi). The family style chicken parm way fried below average . It alson't come any pasta is odd . My friend told the manager horrible our experience and took of the drink the bill and slashed the price half . Glad did but still couldn't make for the miserable experience . This wa the worst restaurant experience service wise that I've ever experienced NYC . I never come back.,1.0 star rating
1031,10,Had reservation two Sunday night . Entered bustling restaurant see horde people inside were waiting get table . My friend I considered going somewhere else; I insisted staying I understood busy holiday weekend; I felt food service would worth end . Wrong . We ended waiting hour finally get table upstairs . At point; were hungry put order wine; appetizer; two entree soon sat . The server friendly enough he took order . Surprisingly; appetizer came relatively quick . But realized plate; my friend missing fork; sat mussel got cold could flag frazzled server utensil . A minute later; we finish mussel; wait 15...20...25 minute...we're wondering wine also everyone seems breadstick u . We flag server our missing drink breadstick . Notice the entire time we're begging attention no one coming check in u . We wait another 15 minute....and finally our meal arrive . We ordered the shrimp scampi turned flavorless bland . The ravioli lamb ragu pretty good little salty . I had been willing to forget the ridiculous wait bad service long the food good; I remember feeling a wave disappointment I realized I wasted money and 2.5 hour my life a mediocre restaurant best . The cherry on top when we received our check included $24 extra for a plate wen't order . Awesome! Overall; I would rank place one star; I'm willing to be a little generous for the acceptable ravioli lamb ragu . Others might have better luck Aunt Jake's . Sadly for me; it felt like everything could go wrong went wrong.,2.0 star rating

For entree I marinara sauce tangilleella (def spelled wrong). My boyfriend went whim tried the squid ink pasta clam . He loved! He usuallyn't try new thing new place I'm happy did he loved! The staff friendly . The owner/manager attentive; always greeting patron checking on u . We opted white wine (Pinot Grigio good). We were stuffed could fit anything else . My recommendation would that have pasta special (one including truffle oil). Lmao that's being biased since I'm a truffle oil die hard .

They got a part order wrong; I got try a new pasta type itn't big a deal . The portion HUGE . Overall; I disappointed the service . I already mentioned got my order wrong; I more bothered an experience one the staff . One the waiter seemed very drunk rather aggressive; I got blank; hard stare him I asked water upon seated freaked me out . He also kept knocking thing smelled like alcohol . Another waiter ultimately came apologized; took table; no explanation happening . The impaired waiter still allowed to stay the room; leaning counter; wandering around staring thing .

1070,10,My friend decided have reunion I made plan have dinner three week advance . Our party five seated 20 minute late squeezed table four . During entire meal; constant movement traffic side table . One friend seated fifth folding chair short side table right pathway skylit room large dining hall . As soon sat; brushed against two wait staff patron . We asked both server manager move u proper table could more comfortable said unfortunately they booked evening given option . So moved table few inch away pathway quickly asked move table back where would block traffic cutlery corner also next to.Well decided stay enjoy other's company celebrate reunion . So ordered bottle prosecco when waiter poured glass; piece dried parsley stuck side glass the prosecco . I asked the waiter have a look disappeared the glass ten minute . When he returned apology; looked if someone stuck finger the glass tried retrieve the dried food the side the glass finger print wet streak along the inside . Also; the dried bit parsley still floating . Could be bothered ask I left shared a glass my boyfriend . Prosecco still refilled the dirty glass the meal . Well started the meatball calamari . Asked the waiter hold cheese one friend lactose intolerant . Food showed cheese so my friend scraped took a chance . The taste pretty good so we enjoyed wa front u . Maybe thing looking . Upon ordering our main; my lactose intolerant friend wa advised all the pasta noodle were made cheese except for the gluten free pasta dish . Again; gluten free pasta dish came grated cheese top it . So we all scooped the cheesy layer had the bit underneath . Her gluten free pasta wa absolute mush for; the worst pasta I've ever had . I asked if we could get a new pasta shen't think it would help . I ordered the farfalle ham pea . The farfalle wa also mushy nearly flat without the crimped shape . My two friend ordered the rabbit ragu we were surprised wa no tomato sauce; bland oily meat and veggie tossed with; ; over cooked pasta . When we asked the server the ragu; he explained ragu never tomato sauce and is actually just meat based . Well what can say that? We were all pretty speechless how poor our evening turned . Also; perhaps top management restaurant reservation; the wait staff; and the kitchen; branding could use a bit work.,1.0 star rating

I taste my friend's pasta dish were ok In't impressed...We also shared a chicken kale caesar salad; ok except I felt wa much dressing . Another disappointment: I came brunch a small group friend . We made reservation . When arrived; host told u were table available inside; only available seating wa outdoors the back patio . It would've ok except wa hot humid just ceiling fan blowing hot air .

During wait; waitress ignored u proceeded continue chatting other table . In't know trying avoid rage first hour; her checking u letting u know food going come made my friend myself even madder . The person came u waiting Javier; gem ...n't even waiter yet; like shining knight; ready save the day . He assured u food coming; another 15 minute; noticed the table next u (literallyn't sitting 30 minute) got meal u . My friend I livid; we got up left...literally walked . I've wasted way much my time this month already the Kavanaugh hearing; Tinder date social medium; no way I willing waste more my time an Italian meal . I've it.Once outside; the manager approached u apologized profusely . He explained wa a mixup the kitchen even agreed comp meal . Hen't; I appreciated gesture wa grateful it . Nice guy...Once back; we got meal immediately original waitress came back our table said``Sorry; wa nothing I could .""She took several year my life she said that . I'm still upset thinking it .

POSITIVE: full generous portion; warm bread; great service-Linguine Nere Alla Monsignore: pasta al dente; generous amount seafood; overall done wellMEH: -Rigatoni Focaccia: okay ;n't blow mind wa recommened . The tomato cream sauce the right ration tomato cream; the chicken could more tender rather chunk chicken breast . NEGATIVE: -Antipasto Trecolori (cheese meat plate): honestly; this wa this most disappointing . Some the cheese tasted like it had put the freezer too long had funky fridge taste--made really sad . There also only 2 slice each meat; would hard share among bigger group.The cheese the pasta offered could have been grated Kraft parmesan .

The dining experience interesting even it like eating an airplane tray . Every time something needed be set; had play dining ware Tetris the table.Service good it clear me they really tried do the best the venue; sacrificing privacy; comfort general safety .

The atmosphere the restaurant felt warm cozy touch rustic vibe . They also a elevator available anyone might need it.CONS: Service wa kinda slow .

1185,11,In't many good thing say this restaurant . The location already tipped food quality --'s right off Times Square; is never good sign--it completely matched expectations.As appetizer I got simple minestrone soup; served hot also bland . The redeeming quality large amount tomato it; potato essentially overpowered the dish . As entree I got salmon filet a side seasonal vegetable . However; the salmon absolutely drenched gelatinous sauce; wa also rather bland; the filet wa; very small . There wa also hardly vegetable a side: one potato; two small string bean a carrot . Hardly $24.My companion alson't a great experience . Most notably wa their cured meat cheese plate; had six stick cheese; six piece thinly sliced meat; a handful olive nearly $30 . Absolutely worth it.My advice? Save money get better Italian a better part the city.,2.0 star rating

There quite a lot of seating take break between the dancing ;) Also update food: came again (this time eat). Korean tapa amazing! Being Korean I tend a little skeptical Korean food in NY but this place wa really authentic . Really enjoyed the fried chicken (asked be made spicy they made it gochujang u it wa good! Crunchy the outside; sweet and spicy & cute bite sized: and my friend joking that it would be perfect a date); kimchi fried rice wa so good with the runny egg top! A must eat .

1208,12,I really really looking forward Silver Factory happy hour deal; rave rating; overall aesthetic I little disappointed In't get five star experience I expecting . I came Monday evening around 6:30 PM restaurant absolutely empty . It nicen't wait table I think people there would contributed a better vibe Silver Factory.I mainly excited happy hour deal - $5 squid leg $9 korean fried chicken . However; run squid leg opted get sausage appetizer instead along soy garlic chicken . Both dish tasted great; happy hour dealn't seem a deal anymore looking portion size . I can't imagine ordering appetizer-sized fried chicken dish $13 (original price) I'm disappointed spending $9 a sausage dish; even discounted price; didn't seem be of high value . My friend I split the kimchi fried rice while tasted sweet; salty; around delicious; the kimchi lacking seemed like white rice marinated red pepper paste sugar . I opted the spicy beef rice; is $1 at least I knew I would be paying meat . In hindsight; it seems excessive have paid $15 rice ($ 13 + $2 because of a fried egg....). I originally a four star rating mind; after getting point the review I think I actually a 3 star experience . The food good; nothing absolutely amazing; service very very very slow even though we were the only party the restaurant; price didn't justify the quality of the food . I think I had come Silver Factory on a weekend evening; experience would've much better in that circumstance; I see myself giving Silver Factory 4 star . But my actual visit slipped my expectation . I'm glad I made the trip; In't have any immediate incentive to revisit this restaurant.,3.0 star rating

For entree miss pan-fried noodle (fresh peppercorn soooo good) spicy beef rice (could spicier guess were trying please everyone).To top off the manager (owner?) treated u to their matcha Tiramisu wa nice subtle: too sweet not too mucha matcha . That wa so nice of him! Both time I've it's pretty quiet; wait usually's least one Korean couple group nearby I take a very good sign .

The toast slightly burnt mackerel delicious . The pulled pork entree so mouth watering delicious I savored every bite portion small relative price ($ 27~). The burger ok; remotely impressed since are plethora bars/cafes restaurant around area serf better quality reasonably priced burger - the burger for $17 . Otherwise; I think the small cafe great vibe though probably the best place dine the warmer weather due no AC near the entrance very low AC the back the cafe They a fan near the intersection outdoor seating close to the entrance seating . There mosquito roaming around I got one two bite during dinner . Hence minus 1 star.",3.0 star rating

Smoke' n ($ 12) a solid drink you enjoy mezcal . Ordered food well - smoked mackerel toast crispy farm raised pork . Both yummy . The mackerel super flavorful the toast just the right texture watch the fishbone . The pork; though; In't even know to start the sour apple the pickled herb piled on top .

I the smoke' n cocktail boyfriend the back fashion . Both the food drink took while come - wouldn't complain the food; felt extra long sincen't drink sip . I didn't end liking my drink switched out peach schnapps cocktail . The food wa all pretty tasty; I wish wa diversity the menu . I think tried hard putting different flavor the crispy pork - it wa much to handle . Maybe ordered too much . Either way; it's probably one the better option the area not a standout.,3.0 star rating

I a little skeptical ordering Roasted Veggie dish; from name content dish; scream``I'm just boring veggie; order if don't want feel guilty only eating meat"".

Next came the most elaborate platter; the Rack Lamb wa the Tuesday special.Plenty chop surprisingly tender considering the volume meat front u (photo: bit.ly/2Bwxboq). The crescendo came the $39.95 Veal Parmigiana - breaded; pan-fried; topped melted mozzarella; ladled generously with marinara sauce - it rested a bed penne (photo: bit.ly/2X0PxHw).

The family an old Italian restaurant vibe many portrait wall making homey feeling . Food: Before ordered; multiple server employee advised u share one plate the portion``family sized""; they lying . We ordered one entree; shrimp linguini; able finish 60% . It's that the foodn't great; the shrimp prawn actually huge! The portion size much two people alone . Then I ordered tiramisu dessert; ; family size . The tiramisu an entire pie! We again; not finish . Conclusion: This place worth try just once; only a party three more! There many family and big party we went! Even a party three ;'s only good you all agree eat the same entree . Otherwise; you order own entree; you will definitely leftover (not necessarily a bad thing). As we were on vacation; we ended giving our leftover a homeless man outside .

In hindsight price commensurate whole aspect salad . Every bit! But didn't order that . Instead concentrated choice linguine seafood . This seafood linguine were told take 20-30 prepare . So we tried not eat bread house . It really good bread variety well . The bowl came it feast! Almost creature the sea in the bowl party u! Lobster mobster; taco (baby octopus); fat succulent shrimp squid . Sorry I missed few you ocean dweller . The amount linguine in the bowl a lot! Good four hungry backpacking gorilla . I chose garlic sauce it it made a really good impression my tummy! My head no choice follow it's path . So two people strategized decided focus the seafood make the linguine a second choice . It hard . Their linguine tasty coated the savory perfectly seasoned garlic sauce . Damn good! George our server funny warm ever present not annoying .

1385,14,This review coming someone raised pure Italians . My mother came visit Philly took day trip NYC visit place . She read review saying's must in city man I glad took u . This place make drool every time I think . It's got wide menu all age . While I not recommend pasta enough ;'s seafood well . The wine delicious tiramisu die . They run discounted lunch special dinner served family style . Which nice be able share everything the giant portion . Also night have different special running . Thankfully the night went wa a four pasta platter . So glad got to try different food a discounted price . And it fed five u! But we also appetizer dessert If're in NYC; you HAVE to go.,5.0 star rating
1386,14,Carmine's serf massive; family-style dish ;'s great place go group . The fare what'd expect any standard Italian restaurant; dress code pretty causal--lot tourist big group . If're going dinner; it's worthwhile get reservation; since midtown location get pretty slammed people catching dinner Broadway show . Sit upstairs; it's bit quieter le chaotic main floor.There seven u we got salad; baked clam; garlic bread; Parmesan chicken; two pasta dish; turned to actually much food (hooray leftover!) I recommend kicking your meal some wine garlic bread . The Caesar salad underwhelming; the baked clam cheesy covered bread crumb perfect a cold January afternoon . For; the star the meal the chicken Parmesan . The meat incredibly tender; the breadingn't too thick or soggy; the red sauce nice flavor.The country-style pasta feature broccoli sausage; tossed pasta a velvety butter sauce; made even creamier the inclusion butter bean . If like rich pasta dish; one for you . We also ordered a gluten-free pasta red sauce . I've a decent amount gluten-free pasta; this among the better batch I've experienced . It a shade soggier the regular pasta; otherwise indistinguishable.,3.0 star rating

She really attentive made sure we had good time . The hot antipasto great; super hot tasty . We really enjoyed everything particularly liked baked clam . The shrimp scampi good; not amazing hot antipasto dish shrimp slightly overcooked . The linguine flavorful; however; saucen't fully mixed the pasta . As a result; the linguine a bit dry bland .

Haven't found place yet doe dish better . The eggplant garlic sauce also one my favorite; although I prefer iteration The Bao . But dear god; SERVICE . In three time I've Han Dynasty; least one dish been forgotten; every time . The hostess always misquote wait time . The waitstaff generally confused; take eternity to bring check . In't expect greatest service ever a Chinese restaurant the East Village; some competency would least nice . I've tried a bunch of other dish at point none blew away . Felt like the famed dan dan noodle inedible (came 30 minute all our other food). Also; play the worst music at loud volume; feel like you're trapped a club the mid-2000s . At my last dinner; past Sunday; they played LMFAO's``Sexy I Know It .""Just--?",3.0 star rating

Overall plain . Dumplings chili oil ($ 8) unmemorable . In't feel like indication spice all accurate.Dry pepper chicken wing ($ 11) best what had . Great wing perfect level spice . I'd come back these alone (simply order). Addictive.The atmosphere middle the road; I like the lighting there's a nice buzz the crowd . Asian lager reasonably priced . Service quick.Overall In't wowed my first visit I'll give a more try there must some secret sauce.,4.0 star rating
1461,15,I'm entirely sure this place popular . But honestly In't impressed the food the price paid . We ordered Dan Dan noodle; cumin lamb; chili pickled fish string bean cold appetizer . Dan Dan noodle tasted significantly different the one I in China ('s very common sichuan street food). Not sure's there's much jiang? The fish dish not even close what it's supposed be like...They added a lot starch the soup really weird...The string bean lamb dish good basic . Free rice complimentary tea nice . Service wa good fairly quick.,3.0 star rating
1462,15,The Philadelphia chain 2 location NYC! Our go spot only 1 thing: Dan Dan Noodles . I yet encounter spot the city such good option Dan Dan.Also; notable thing cumin fry & eggplant garlic sauce .

1463,15,This restaurant worth hype . It always packed around dinner time . They let put name waitlist virtually great; time estimaten't accurate be prepared wait bit anyways . The inside table stacked closely together some table shared tables.We group four shared whole bunch thing . To start; got dumpling; Dan Dan noodle; pork bun sesame noodle . We LOVED three our favorite sesame noodle . These great flavor just right spice level . We various level spice tolerance; next a dish varying spice level . We got the scallion pork; the Kung pao chicken; dry pepper shrimp . The scallion pork Kung pao chicken were great . The Kung pao chicken my favorite the two . In't try the dry pepper shrimp supposed be crazy spicy; others liked it too! They had a small beer wine selection doe the trick . Price is very reasonable . Definitely a good spot Asian food!,5.0 star rating
1464,15,Came on Friday night around 8 wait around 35 minute table . Luckily had seat bar area u sit inside we waited.The dan dan noodle just ok . This first time I ordered from little peanuty lacked flavor . Also the noodle slightly cooked my liking . I would skip order of the other dish . I also slightly disappointed the dry pepper chicken time . Itn't crispy I remember and seemed a little thrown together . Still good but not good I've had it other places.String bean and fish spicy sauce were bomb though!,4.0 star rating
1465,15,It's hard find good Sichuan-type place West Coast I able fulfill craving I . They wicked spicy wanton; spicy dumpling equally good! I came here mostly take spicy wanton back SO I got back West; I thoroughly enjoyed their food well.I would say In't get anything I thought too spicy I couldn't handle . For; I'd say's a bit Westernized; I think chef still quite skilled making meat tender the veggie savory the flavor Sichuan the NY crowd.I also bought to-go; I'm sure the food would been even better; piping hot the restaurant.I'd definitely back next time I'm the city . The wait long enough go grab boba come back wait pick the food . Ambience low lighting open space; make me think more casual date small friend group 3-6.,4.0 star rating
1466,15,"I came Dan Dan noodle . They alright.The fried chicken pretty good . Nice crispy right ways.There some incident today service go order . Didn't happen specifically; someone waited hour carry order . When brought food woman; said unacceptable . The woman; appeared manager; apologized explained large order ahead hers $1; 000's took long they gave some free soup . The woman went back forth unacceptable manager lady got huge attitude; even extent said want complimentary soup gave? I've lot place rarely I seen someone treated way restaurant . To top off; delivery driver; had also waiting extremely long time; attempted explain manager (order help fix a process clearly flawed restaurant) woman upset people kept telling her the food wa coming 5 min 30 min . Instead accepting the advice; she essentially came with excuse . The delivery driver asked her an estimate his food (ended coming 5 min later) she said``an hour""- a upset sarcastic manner she walked away . If have issue restaurant - your patron service people the last one be taking out . Long story short - the manager treated 2 people; one whom wa attempting help her; extremely rudely . The customer always right . She should have comped the poor woman's food; apologized the first place . I rarely comment length service; wa egregious . My neighbor the bar even commented me the whole situation wa killing the mood . In addition; In't think wa a bar tender working; pretty much the staff ignored all of u sitting the bar . If order delivery -'s probably going to take a while . The management clearly don't care customers- the delivery driver company . I may order the chicken; the whole situation really turned me off this place . On one positive note: When the bartender show right I left; wa extremely attentive . So wa least one small amount of positive to the trip.I typically write review that focus the food . I almost never add remove star the service that's not what I'm there . This review rating based primarily the service I experienced today . One star for the food . One for the nice bartender .

1476,15,First time Han Dynasty surprisingly I went NY spot rather Philly locations.We went a group five a Friday managed squeeze a table; got lucky restaurant absolutely packed . They squished u a four seater table wouldn't been issue; table next u also five people . This led some awkward brush ups menu falling of tables.The waitressn't really seem care our order; hostess seating u immediately somewhat made that.The food pretty good . We got the dan dan noodle; the string bean; the dry pepper chicken; the wonton chili oil . All of it delicious I would recommend ordering family style for a large group .

Luckily it wa nice evening waiting outside restaurant wa seated 8:30pm . The entire time eating meal; we constantly rushed passive way; including bill dropped onto table we middle scooping food mouth; very subtle . I looked around see we were the one rushed; it turn others were receiving the speed eating treatment a well . I understand that the goal is have high turnover order get customer our the door generate revenue; if I'm paying a premium a modern/hipster-esq Chinese restaurant the least could is let eat in peace; allow to ask my bill . We ordered 5 dish 2 rice bowl; the bill came to approx . $20 per person tax tip; and wa the door within 30 minute; choice .

They a large selection food I wanted try I settled Cumin lamb told make extra spicy.The spice packed a punchn't overbearing . I thought much flavor! Very authentic food friendly staff .

We lucky enough able get reservation; server constantly letting u know be by certain time . They nice it; it make dining experience slightly stressful . I hear a quick efficient delivery; might be way go! As for the food; I really enjoyed almost everything--we had a LOT! Among the standouts the dan dan noodle (kindly made both spicy mild version); the sesame noodle; the dry fried shrimp fish; the pea shoot . Wow! We also had plenty other goody I don't usually try like beef tendon; po tofu; a garlicky beef dish that wa wonderful well . The staff very busy frazzled; theyn't forget anything they on top of it thing like drink order; bagging our leftover; etc . I think they're used being swamped night!

The interior is very low key chill; smell inside restaurant amazing!!! Highlights have to Dan dan noodle; string bean; the beef cooked the soupy oil; the pan fried dumpling; the cold pork belly chili oil! Absolutely amazing . Spicy & flavorful & too pricey .

1495,15,Han Dynasty Sichuan restaurant got start Philadelphia; I went college . I frequented location off campus least dozen time; held hope their New York location would good . Sadly case.Do get wrong; location still quite good . The menu somewhat condensed; still feature many hit kept coming back location . My favorite appetizer non-spicy entree wonton chili oil; three cup chicken; course dan dan noodle . As the spicy entree; much matter personal taste . I like spicy fish; I always get the dry pot style fish . Served mini wok; is rated 10/10 Han Dynasty's spice scale; brings main criticism restaurant . The 10 is only mildly spicy; probably a 6/10 the Philadelphia location . Even upon request; the spice level some sort ceiling that simply exceeded . As I a spice lover; is a shortcoming that I just cannot overlook . Otherwise; I would dining every week.With great service solid food; Han Dynasty is one of the better restaurant East Village . If like Sichuan food are okay a lower spice level; this is the place . More likely not; you will have some leftover to take home trust; are better leftover those a Sichuan restaurant.,4.0 star rating

The Rice Noodlesn't much flavor to them aside sausage; I ended not even finishing the dish the next day . Would probably go back the Dan Dan Noodles one the main entree; for review; I'd to say the Dan Dan Noodles a 5/5 the Taiwanese Sausage Rice Noodles a 2 3 of five . Service quick; Han Dynasty deserves a 4/5 for my experience!,4.0 star rating

1511,15,I horrible experience customer service Han Dynasty . It started I called make order; I asked dish would similar general tso; basically anything pan fried sauce . The man line (Harrison F) extremely rude; told Han Dynasty specializes authentic Chinese food I find more Americanized Chinese restaurant street . He also instructed look menu calling; even though I reading menu I called . I understand care restaurant take ensuring authentic Chinese cuisine; I really appreciate; I simply asking question the menu; expecting condescending response . I ordered the Dry Pepper Style Chicken; then realized that I wanted; I called back change order no one picked . After 20 ring; I decided go the restaurant (2 minute walk) change order person . When I asked switch the Kung Pao Chicken; Harrison another woman working told there no way change the order already made . I told that I called multiple time no one picked; they responded telling me that something must wrong my phone . I extremely angry; decided order dumpling addition the chicken I deserved at that point . In the end; I ended waiting around 15 minute the food; get single refund the employee . This a Sunday night; (apparently one their busiest night) it obvious that other people noticed the poor service they receiving complaint the diner . I paid $26.02 a meal I did want completely; only got a half-assed apology the staff . The dumpling good; the chicken alright; it wa what I wanted .

Once sat; waiter came asked u wanted drink (still/tap/fizzy) water right I taking my jacket . Ok; fine . Literally even two second later; another waitress come asks we'd like (for water). I told we were already served gave stank look . This unacceptable; especially night like Valentine's Day.For drink; we ordered Madhatter's Brew another drink (forgot name ginger orange it). The Madhatter's brew weird random tea leaf it weren't mentioned menu; I would recommend drink . The drink really good though . It's ironic it made a mixologist; pretty weak.... Wouldn't come for drinks.NOW.... For amazing food; I fell LOVE Mac & cheese ($ 9). It creepy gooey; made gouda gave it a unique; smokey flavor . The breadcrumb could've more cooked/baked though.Spicy Meatballs ($ 15) - Delicious! The spicen't overbearing all . However; best part appetizer tzatiki sauce pita bread . Ugh; amazing I wish appetizer the sauce bread.Main Dishes: -I ordered Uncle Tommy's Pie ($ 17). It definitely look better the photo I thought the top layer would really cheesy . Instead; it's a hearty dish definitely needed kind sauce compliment the mashed potatoes.-Also tried half of the English Muffin Burger . Once; the delicious Gouda used the burger . So yummy!!! The fry had salt & pepper them and came a delicious aoli . Overall; this place really good and had a romantic vibe it . However; I really NOT like waitress all . If I asked to repeat or asked wa my drink specifically; she gave a snobby look . Not okay.,4.0 star rating

The tuna tartare came on bed guacamole; served chip . It big enough for 2 people share . They skimp on tuna; the star the dish.The spicy lamb meatball amazing! Dare I say better the regular meatball? Although could taste the lamb; overpowering . The tzatziki sauce gave additional depth the meatball . I wish meatball! The order came 4 small meatball; the meatball the highlight the night.The green pasta really good . The spinach tagliatelle served really juicy shrimp delicious cream sauce . The cream sauce wa different any sauce I've ever tasted . It seemed to be a blend black pepper; garlic; butter some sweet ingredient I could not distinguish .

1519,16,BOTTOMLESS BRUNCH IS NO MORE . I honestlyn't know rate BEA anymore . So have new brunch menu; taken away bottomless brunch . That quite unwelcome surprise I hope'll working their new prix fixe menu future some item considered main ($ 15) absolutely main (see: scrambled egg). Food mostly delicious (n't bother Caesar salad) service mostly good (had ask table ricotta supposed get); I'm very enthusiastic returning . I've told basically everyone I know go...I'm going stop offering suggestion . Food: both prix fixe brunch . This entail picking one item three section . Since supposed get ricotta (had ask the end the meal); I ordered the Caesar salad; bacon; French toast . The salad truly awful . It huge unappetizing soggy mound green soaked death dressing half rotten (know gross slimy green indicate's time yo throw out?). These were sprinkled Parmesan I got half crouton . It's like people come class the gym don't try enough sweat . Why bother this? Moving; the bacon truly divine the French Toast fairly main sized; lot fruit thick; delicious brioche . My partner got egg (we could split the main pretend it bottomless brunch) their scrambled egg out this world (I wish I could make egg taste good); it's absolutely ridiculous these considered a main . If BEA want be jerk their menu's fine; don't even try say a few egg a $15 main . Generally; food passing seemed be pointedly fairly main sized ridiculous small plate I used love.So; I think three star fair . As good some meal wa; part were bad . Zero star the new menu I'm really bummed to have lost my previously favorite brunch spot a result their changing the menu the worse . Farewell; BEA.,3.0 star rating

1525,16,3 start stunning decor food seriously lacking . Came based great review disappointed . For appetizer kale Caesar & Tuna tartare guacamole . Kale Caesar- poorly prepped kale; stem left; chopped properly felt like I chewing a bush; salad properly dressed mixed; seemed like chef splashed Caesar dressing cheese top the rest the leaf dry . Tuna tartare- initially appears tuna tartare lying a bed guacamole soon be discovered mostlychopped tomato masquerading tuna....come kitchen this day age should know better . Barely tuna that dish . Chilean seabass- small portion (photo deceiving) fish served a bed brussel sprout corn a ton friend onion mixed (I wish included the description portion the menu) fish wa delicious grilled perfection the accompanying item a miss Shepard's pie- lacking flavor under salted Hazelnut latte- prob the tastiest thing the menu; wasGoodLemon custard- so Overall a restaurant every corner; I would not return this place .

The size the shrimp wa a good respectable size they actually give a lot shrimp; my dish had seven piece meaty shrimp .

1530,16,I came large group friend Saturday brunch . Our waitress really accommodating our group arriving different time wa attentive our numerous order requests.We opted bottomless food; is $28 per person . It's good deal! It's essentially price three dish ($ 9); dish pretty small - tapa style - you're than likely get money's worth bottomless option.My favorite dish the asparagus mushroom; smoked salmon pita; French toast . The truffle oil garlic the asparagus mushroom dish made amazing . We ordered something around 6 them; couldn't get enough! The smoked salmon came with a drizzle honey; surprisingly gave a pop flavor even enhanced the salmon flavor.The scrambled egg egg benedict disappointing . The scrambled eggn't any flavor . The egg benedict inconsistently cooked - some came basically hard boiled others running yolks.Overall; great group; good value the bottomless brunch option!,4.0 star rating

We ordered: - House ricotta cheese: Very nice I can't see you go wrong combination . - Duck turnover: I thought I'd give this try since's highly recommended . Turned a HUGE disappointment . The turnover soggy greasy . I confused the taste cause were many mismatched flavor going (sweet; sour; salty; cheesy..) I alson't see duck meat?? we assumed would cause the name . - Lamb chop: We asked medium rare grilled perfectly! It super tender the sauce a little sweet . - Green pasta: SO GOOD! But's a very heavy dish the butter/cream . I've this several time never disappoints . - Stuffed chicken: My FAVORITE dish the night! The chicken breast shockingly juicy a crispy flavorful skin . The stuffed pepper insanely rich . Everything melted together top this delicious mushroom cream sauce . The plate size needed be bigger cause super messy eat! - Cheesecake: I wa so upset to find that no longer serve chocolate lava cake fig ice cream . So we settled for cheesecake In't enjoy it at all .

The interior boast brick wall; lovely lighting candle each table; bar center main dining room; beautiful intimate seating inside sheer pale; dusty pink drape; well lively open space outdoor courtyard garden back brick wall; funky artwork showing music album cover; tree fairy light; green plant; red tile floor; long table . After let waitress know wanted Bottomless Food option; explained they would bring 2-3 dish time they came order appears menu . I thought order dish organized perfectly . I tried everything; except smoked salmon In't eat/like raw fish . I like plated a white plate rimmed gold . The combination pink; beige; green red pretty . The smoked salmon came top pita bread underneath green tomato . There cream cheese; dill; honey mint salmon well . + House Ricotta: Toasted bread side a ball light; fluffy ricotta honey herb top . The ricotta honey a delightful combination; however the bread hard a bit too burnt.+ Kale Caesar: This salad included crouton; parmesan housemade dressing . There plenty dressing the kale nicely crisp fresh.+ Satueed Asparagus: The asparagus mixed mushroom supposedly cooked white truffle oil . I could really taste the truffle oil the vegetable steamed the perfect degree . + Turkey Sausage: The sausage looked okay; extremely hard (I couldn't cut the knife) the tasted bland . This least favorite part the meal . + Breakfast Potatoes: This consisted Yukon potato; thyme; rosemary smoked paprika . I enjoyed hearty wonderfully flavorful dish . The potato all the spice throughgout really yummy! + Spinach Egg Pie: Made steamed egg; spinach; red pepper chervil; looked really appetizing lacked flavor . The shell buttery flaky; the egg spinachn't enough seasoning.+ Eggs Benedict: Classic dish featuring egg easy Canadian bacon English muffin the bottom . I normally don't like my egg easy Canadian bacon particular dish worked really well . The egg a tasty yellow sauce a sprinkling pepper it . The egg; bacon toasted muffin a great combination! + Pork Shoulder: I loved one! It consisted pork shoulder; pineapple pinepaple sauce; red kidney bean . The pork incredible tender; juicy full flavor . The addition the pineapple unique amazing . All the ingredient mingled together perfectly.+ Baked Scrambled Eggs: This mozzerella; chervil tomato sauce . It very cheesy I liked a lot the egg tasteless.+ Candied Thick Cut Bacon: Definitely another favorite mine . The bacon cooked brown sugar; maple chipotle . I able discern the taste each came spriral form . The bacon also intensely crispy very little fat the way I like it.+ Brioche French Toast: The piece de resistance; had nutella caramel sauce drizzled the plate; strawberry banana slice on top the french toast; maple syrup on the side finally; powdered sugar covering the plate . The french toast moist slightly crunchy the berry were a refreshing touch . The nutella/caramel made it much more delectable . It quite sweet in a good way . Our waitress wa lovely . She wa very attentive never left u with an empty plate . She always made sure that we had the next brunch menu item asked throughout the meal there wa any dish we wanted more .

Everything fantastic the notable would to the French toast (is still talking it); mushroom asparagus kale Caesar salad . We ordered twice . The spinach pie egg Benedict very good . Also; the house ricotta smoked salmon nice . If I had one complaint is that the end; you've eaten a ridiculous amount egg bread . Home fry baked egg not memorable . Again; we a large group; the amount sausage bacon they gave u would been great . We sat the bar had a very nice woman serving u Alissa/Alyssa (I got pretty tipsy didn't catch the spelling) very attentive yet laid back .

1605,16,The reason I give place two star server . We awful service here . The server barely came u; checked u; got u drink . I thought there lot people; seemed like were getting their drink (LOL). My friend got an ale; server said stout . So saidn't order stout; server kept saying stout like wa fault . We spoke English; yet attitude I felt wa he kind ignored u he assumed couldn't speak/understand English . Turned wa ale....the server got wrong...sigh . The frustration kept going when needed check . Since server didn't come u one cup beer; decided leave . However; the server never come...we went to the front asked a check . The hostess wa nice she took care it us.Long story short; it ha a good vibe maybe good drink . But sometimes; service change whole experience the place . Usuallu I leave bar happily drunk; yet today; I felt bad leaving the bar.,2.0 star rating

Reservations available Resy plentiful than week; I'd recommend reserving possible; though's good room wait drink service . The space cool--industrial space soaring ceiling perfect lighting.The cocktail list brief (5) cheap ($ 12); simple ingredient herbal garnish . Unfortunately; the two sake-based one we tried; Basil Shiso; tiny low ABV; I'd rather grab a drink the area stick sake shochu here.The menu open a diagram a chicken; nonono a beak-to-tail (okay; neck-to-tail) skewer program . We went heart ($ 3) chicken oyster ($ 3.5); delectably juicy . We also yuzukosho nori ($ 4.5); chicken thigh a dark citrus spread; well some kind special short rib skewer lovely . The skewer the first couple page small I'd get least one per person; the larger special one shareable.From plated dish; nori tofu ($ 6) rather plain came a promotional glass sake . Scallop uni carpaccio ($ 15) ended being my favorite dish the night; tender raw scallop a nice basil reduction.Service wa great . Bathrooms clean . Vibe very nice . Although portion small; wa surprisingly affordable leave full . In't know In't back yet ;'s a real treat there's a lot menu to explore.,5.0 star rating
1691,18,After seeing Nonono pop on friend's social medium multiple time month; I excited try . I love Japanese Izakaya style food; it be hit miss NYC . Nonono pleasantly surprising; large menu reasonable pricing . The dish small; I liked our group able try variety dish . I felt menu diverse; definitely stretch beyond the typical ramen-sushi-tempura vibe; though offer dish well.The restaurant is modern minimalistic; both table counter seating . On Saturday 6:30pm; able get counter seating immediately out reservation; the wait a table would been hour +; def . recommend a reservation group 4 over . Service very quick friendly; they managed refill drink without noticing several times.My favorite dish the nori tofu; a chilled tofu avocado; nori tsukudani; a wasabi sauce; the daiichi mushroom; fried mushroom topped a chunk scallop a basil pesto cream . The Natchatte steak the potato salad were also delicious! The three u ordered 13 dish total; it ended being $60 tax tip; not super cheap reasonable the amount seafood meat ordered . Food came out quickly service wa super efficient.,4.0 star rating
1692,18,"I made reservation 2 people Saturday 8:45pm seems most walk in no problem getting seated right away . The interior shaped like long hallway . It's quite interesting . I recommend going upstairs you get chance . Service good the food came very quickly . We ordered: - Salmon tataki: Delicious nothing spectacular . I think wouldve better the salmon completely raw . The mashed avocado sweetened soy sauce great pair . - Kinoko cream skewer: Good bland me . The chicken thigh wasnt marinated the cream lacked``truffle""flavor . My friend loved though . - Daichi mushroom: Yum! The mushroom juicy plumped . The basil cream very good again it overall too bland me . We also Asahi draft beern't great...I think cocktail may the better choice . Overall a good experience . I appreciate they use fresh ingredient . The portion were tiny everything wa too simple catch attention . Not sure I be returning.",4.0 star rating
1693,18,Came without reservation Friday 6:30 only waited around 25-30 minute . I think get at 7:30 later you might hour two wait . The restaurant super cute service also terrific--good small group friend also great a date friend two most their table smaller 2 person table . Tried eel appetizer super good--well soba (good; a little salty my taste). Got rain drop cake dessert to try once .

There many bar seating people flexible . Overall service quick waiter are friendly . I would come back another time.,5.0 star rating
1695,18,My friend I entered restaurant 7 PM Tuesday night . I would recommend anyone come restaurant make reservation hand establishment pretty crowded wait involved . However; timen't bad . It around 20 minute sat bar by time done them; table ready . For drink I ordered Basil cocktail delicious . It sweet strawberry really mixed well . In't feel like I drinking alcohol . The indoor decor also hipster Asian everything lighting furniture . Additionally; bathroom situated upstairs narrow area overlooking entire restaurant . And someone terrified height; in area fun . For food decided order few dish share: -JP PASTA: The flavor the pasta very delicious . Great combination the sauce the seafood . The thing slightly salty; might been that theyn't compensate the salt the seafood they added salt the dish all solid dinner choice!--Chicken Heart Yakitori: I such a big chicken heart lover these heart ok; a little chewy salty since drenched salt crystal .--Chicken Oyster Yakitori: Really delicious! Soft meat nice flavor .--Short Rib Onions Yakitori: These short rib amazingly delicious! A must try the onion really mixed well the meat .--Skirt Meat Shishito Yakitori: The meat wa a bit chewy taste the flavor wa good shishito is always great .--Tamago Bacon Yakitori: We ordered this dish along our order; however; must been lost we got the very end we reminded the waiter . The whole dish wa very disappointing; the egg wa cold not have much flavor the truffle salt didn't taste like much just made really salty .--Scallop Uni Carpaccio: I love uni ;'s honestly one my favorite seafood item so I always excited any chance eat . The whole dish worked very well together . The nori wa a little bit abrasive I guess slightly worked . However; even though we spent all that money (close 100 dollar) ordered all those item; my friend I still starving at the end . Therefore; even though the food great taste; the portion were just way small make one feel truly full.,4.0 star rating
1696,18,If're looking huge variety solid Japanese food lot chic hipster; place . It took month get normal dinner reservation time; worth wait . Most plate tiny (like Japanese tapa); normallyn't great it mean you get try thing HUGE menu! The menu also picture every single dish; make making decision a little easier (harder since everything look tasty ...) My favorite item ordered actually ramen - ordered it last minute rest the small platen't fill our belly . The Tori Tantan ramen one the best ramens I had ever . It is definitely Ippudo Toto . The noodlen't cooked the broth creamy full flavor . It the perfect amount spiciness . You must try the ramen here! Other dish tried I recommend ordering: Nonono Kara Age (fried chicken wing); Zuke Maguro (tuna sashimi jalapeño sauce); ALLLL the skewer . I guess the skewer is what make NONONO stand because there aren't many Japanese restaurant NYC specialize this . My favorite the Lime Cilantro chicken skewer (one the popular; for good reason) Atsuyaki Tofu Miso (deep fried tofu). The Kinoko mushroomn't extremely interesting; even u mushroom lover . We definitely coming back try more skewer ramen!,4.0 star rating
1697,18,Our dining experience uniquely named modern Japanese yakitori establishment so-so (). While I appreciate vision concept behind restaurant; execution fell short . The space absolutely beautiful; however interior designer went little far their quest give this place rustic-industrial look . The exposed concrete; purposefully worn tile floor; open wash sink second floor make diner feel like are eating their parent basement laundry room rather chic Japanese Izakaya.Two additional pet peeve . - One; service almost non-existent . The waitstaff not check-in table inquire needed refill our alcoholic beverage provided overview menu upon seated . Interestingly; table bro's next u crushing unlimited supply beer pitchers.- Two; menu is unnecessarily complex doen't achieve right balance small large plate . For context; ordered eight separate dish two people.None dish memorable - flavor were subtle ordinary . We ordered : 1) selection meat vegetable skewer (chicken neck meat; short rib onion; eel; the shishito pepper); 2) duck nanbam; 3) ikayaki (squid); 4) torus tantan ramen; 5) kani fried rice . Our yakitori pretty solid - our favorite the shishito pepper . The duck nanbam a clear miss - way much mayo the egg salad topping . The torus tantan ramen your basic standard run the mill ramen - albeit appropriately spicy.All-in; we wouldn't return were a bit disappointed given the hype surrounding Nonono.P.S . is with the duct tape holding together the screen the sliding bathroom door?!,3.0 star rating

1699,18,Great Japanese shareable restaurant . They open dinner 5pm I would recommend making reservation! We made one 6:45pm place already packed there bit wait others . Presentation beautiful tasten't bad either . The serving definitely smaller great being able try a bit everything . They're known yakitori skewer the creamy udon; I recommend . Creamy udon: Such interesting concept . Looks weird first delicious! Curry; slightly spicy udon; a bed whipped mashed potato . It's filling the creaminess the potato balance the curry flavor well . Skewers - a few beef one the chicken meatball . The skirt steak is delicious; the chicken oyster . Skewers about $3 so doe add . Zuke Maguro: Tuna sashimi jalapeno sauce . The jalapeno sauce nice the tuna great itself . (Hamakama Nikomi) Yellowtail miso sauce: Miso sauce the winner . The fish delicious could been tender.Nanchatte Steak: My favorite; right next the udon! We liked so much got another order . There's flavored onion top the sauce cooked delicious . The steak tender wa also overdone.Kani fried rice: My least favorite . Just alright . Rice wa a little dry there wan't distinct flavor . We added of the miso sauce the fish elevate it.It wa a great dining experience overall . Good shareable serving size but pricey what get . Would come back the creamy udon.,4.0 star rating
1700,18,I'm happy I found nonono; I'll back sure . Small plate often mean're spending than you want still leaving slightly hungry; flavor are worth . We a reservation did have wait . - Nori tofu: Yum; get . 4/5.- Tako sumiso (octopus): 5/5- Salmon tataki: probably favorite; and In't even usually like salmon . 5/5- Zuke maguro (tuna): sooo good . 5/5.- Nasu dengaku (eggplant): 4/5- kinoko mushroom: the sauce the middle great . 3/5.We ordered assortment yakitori well - amazing a the rest the food (3/5 generally); still pretty decent .

1701,18,I came solo dinner Monday night able snag last seat counter . There several group waiting table I'm guessing's best make reservation . It's a yakitori restaurant getting skewer a must . I the shisamo; okra; scallop; unagi; shrimp they delicious; perfectly grilled; lightly seasoned . 1 order come 1 skewer in case's one piece if're multiple people'll want order 1 per person . In't end trying the meat option since I'm a seafood fanatic; I'll definitely try the next time I come . Sashimi plate also good . It 3 different kind of fish they all tasted fresh . I the Shiso cocktail wa amazingly refreshing really really good . I would highly recommend drink.,4.0 star rating
1702,18,FYI: Definitely sharing restaurant come group friend . This place also mad popular make reservation coming! PROS: Ohhh goodness . The flavor god blessed place . Everything ordered their menu (big small plate) absolutely delicious . I can't even remember everything got cause kinda went little crazy . Their cocktail also amazing definitely worth trying . Our favorite night probably the tamago bacon; wa soft boiled egg slice bacon wrapped around a sprinkling truffle salt . Ugh . I could eat 6 plate not get sick . Their meat also cooked perfectly matter type ordered what plate size . I recommend ordering one two their bigger plate some their yakitori skewer option the side . Trust ;'re gonna want try a bit of everything have eye on.CONS: This place jam packed and mad popular definitely come prepped a reservation . Their system a bit wonky though - it told friend that our reservation been cancelled like 30 min the time when got they still took u anyways.,5.0 star rating
1703,18,I came group friend a week night . We seated upstairs . - Scallop uni - fresh garnish worked well - Dragonball - loved the sauce . Wish came some rice go along with it- Curry udon -n't really like . The sauce too heavy didn't balance well - raindrop dessert lemon sorbet surprisingly good.,4.0 star rating
1704,18,Here seems be popular skewer drink . Their option mostly tapa noodle . Some tapa / appetizer I recommend deep fried eggplant; fried chicken current special: Tako wasabi . The eggplant supposed be deep fried itn't taste fried...More like steamed super flavorful sweet peanut topping . The fried chicken came 3 drum -n't like typical popcorn chicken order else . I really liked their yuzu plum wine cocktail lemon - came twice ordered same . For skewer were mostly okay...In't like chicken breast scallion the chicken thigh cream truffle...(overwhelming). I think favorite one remains the beef tongue . Must try!,4.0 star rating
1705,18,A group 8 u dined on Sunday evening everyone loved! I made reservation 2 week advance could get 8:30pm reservation I would recommend making reservation far advance possible big group . We sat somewhat privately nice surprise make nonono perfect group . Another perk bigger group wa great sharing bunch small plate trying little bit everything . We stuck mostly non-seafood option loved pretty much everything we tried . The veggie; beef chicken skewer all big hit well Duck Nanban eggplant . Ironically enough; the seafood dish we ordered wa the Zuke Maguro (tuna sashimi) everyone said could live without . The only thing I would note (n't a bad thing) is that is a slow; spaced dinner . Everything came fairly quickly we out there le 1.5 hour . I would definitely recommend nonono a group dinner that won't break the bank will leave everyone satisfied without being too full keep drinking dinner.,5.0 star rating
1706,18,The experience overall great; one major few minor detail improve on.The wait around hour Saturday 7 pm; sat 8 shared table . I usuallyn't big issue sharing table; reallyn't happen at price point (especially new party taken this table ask change ;n't feel right).We sat got Japanese black beer; scallop uni; hamakama; oden starter . The scallop uni THE best throughout meal; fresh great starting point skewer . The hamakama also great; only portion light miso used . Unfortunately; scale fully scrapped . The oden good; not excellent; though I think it's a must try.For skewer; got chicken oyster; beef tongue; short rib; shishamo; tamago bacon; yuzukosho nori; skirt meat . The beef overall excellent (the temp; dressing; chewiness lived to standard). Although I usuallyn't eat chicken; I found the chicken oyster juicy crispy the outer end . The tamago also a joy; fried truffle oil . I believe this place doen't take a reservation a weekend night come early and get line.Service pretty good; people hosted u all nice people . Price wa reasonable well . Placing u above three digit two people.food 4/5service 4/5price 4/5ambiance 4/5,4.0 star rating

Beef tongue...I realize sound exotic many; if haven't tried yet ;'re missing! It's extremely flavorful obscenely tender . Oden also must-get item . In fact ;'s so addictive; I could probably finish two bowl by myself.The service also great . No delay bringing our food the waitstaff super cordial.",5.0 star rating
1711,18,Okokok; nothing else go mushroom cocktail alone . The rest pretty great . It's potentially overwhelming beast menu shareable plate; sushi; yakitori etc; though mostly stuck small plate (perfect for 3 people). LOVED 4 mushroom sampling; particularly marinated enoki . The crab fried rice; corn; kara age dragon ball (beef w/quail egg) great . The Nonono roll left something be desired honestly among everything ordered nothing bad - dish just memorable others.Cocktails excellent - I ordered kyuri; refreshing mix gin; mint; cucumber; lime; basically everything I look for in summer libation . I stole a sip my friend's beet cocktail vodka; lemon grapfruit . SO GOOD - far veggie based drink go; I've had beet bourbon this a surprising winner.,4.0 star rating

1714,18,Great atmosphere; good food overall nice experience.RESERVATIONS: Made reservation week advance dinner Sunday night 5:30 pm available! When got; wouldn't seat u entire party there.ATMOSPHERE: The inside minimalist Japanese heath ceramic vibe darker color; darker ceramic slightly imperfect; wood etc . They entire downstairs; upstairs table; then bathroom area then 2 larger table back . It's nice restaurant date; take parent when visiting nicer dinner . The downstairs where see cooking though I see bar areas.FOOD: They are known their yakitori a pretty wide range item their menu . It's divided section a bit overwhelming first; might best come a group you can order a lot item with.CHICKEN WING - favorite type yakitori; they make like David Chang where entire chicken wing skewer . Lightly salted slightly crispy; good . It's small though I would recommend getting 2! CHICKEN SKIN - bit chicken skin the skewer make crispy little bit . My friend said prefers a different way are more crunchy what is used to.SHORT RIB - tender meat good flavor; really enjoyed one . PORK WITH TARE - also very good pork; almost tasted like pork sparerib meat without the bone.TOFU WITH AVOCADO AND SEAWEED - a really refreshing dish slightly firm silky tofu then fresh avocado top this savory seaweed/wasabi paste top that gave the flavor . Would definitely recommend . KARAAGE - a lighter karaage ;'s actually served the bone; is interesting . tender juicy; good the outer crust pretty crispy . DRAGON BALL - the lease interesting dish; look spicy the picture isn't all . ha ground tofu piece a savory sauce quail egg piece cooked sliced beef the middle . It wa decent; I probably wouldn't recommend.DUCK - the duck wa kind tough! it wan't melt your mouth a bit disappointing . The skin the outer edge wa a bit crispy overall; that great a dish.Overall; I would stick to the skewer the dish on the second third page the rest of the itemn't that amazing . The price are probably a bit higher other yakitori place you're really paying for good atmosphere/aesthetics.,4.0 star rating
1715,18,I ordered special trio consisting: wasabi octopus; seaweed wrapped tuna; white fish sliced onion . This dish wa amazing; long you enjoy spice! The nori tofu octopus sashimi also really good .

The one I felt more forgettable: - Duck ankake- Dragon ball (beef dish quail egg; I think) - Nonono rollThere so many item the menu wen't get chance try I'm sure's possible to have a near-perfect meal you know to order . Also a sleek; modern decor a good amount seating upstairs downstairs (though I thought wa weird they seated u a communal table there were lot open four top upstairs).

1717,18,Nonono recreates traditional Japanese food modern twist . Came Tuesday 6:00 two friend . We immediately seated restaurantn't packed . Restaurant serf Tapas based portion Japanese food we ordered bunch stuff share . AMBIANCE: It's nice date place . It's overly dark; there two floor . Decor pretty modernist minimalist; nothing stand too much . No music playing background great conversation . PROS: Where start? Highlights definitely Hamakama Nikomi (Yellowtail); Salmon Tataki; Nasu Dengaku (roasted eggplant). Yellow tail incredibly umami flavored sauce soy based slightly honey hint acidity; greatly complimented yellowtail collarbone meat . Fish incredibly moist well seasoned . Salmon Tataki is fresh you get sashimi salmon - garnished on top bowl guacamole (Japanese Guac?) sweet soy sauce based sauce . Definitely an interesting combination flavor . And finally Nasu Dengaku strong garlicky flavor - delicious roasted a nice crisp! Dragonball their Raindrop pudding very unique dish . Dragonball a great sauce incredibly flavorful . Rainbow roll your standard tuna/salmon roll avocado - can't go wrong . CONS: Raindrop pudding although unique (incredibly jiggly); surprisingly too flavorful . My friend enjoyed - IMO I thought sweet sauce that came not compliment rather bland flavor pudding it tasted gelatin water . The powered ginger also made it difficult swallow it tends get caught in throat I cough a few time afterwards . Teba gyozas - the chicken wing; very seasoned bland . It wa such a shame considering juicy the chicken wa . Seasoning could aggressive . Quail egg the Dragonball very cold bland! Need add more salt that thing! MISC: Pricesn't too terrible; a we ended getting a bill ~ $90 7 tapa; our party three wa pretty full . OVERALL: Great unique experience of Japanese food Nonono! Would avoid a few tapa recommend the restaurant to adjust they would make it and presentation; overall had a positive experience!,4.0 star rating
1718,18,nonono definite yesyesyes me! Loved yakitori offering :) The con me portion a bit small; course lead ordering a larger amount yakitori; then lead $$ $$ $.

Will definitely go try thing; and will of course get tofu a wa ~heavenly~.,5.0 star rating

1721,18,I good experience! Thought restaurant small outside looking inside actually felt like had a fair amount seating . Probably like 10 so counter seat both upstairs downstairs two person table a couple bigger group area . Sat counter since I by (walked no wait Friday party 1). Staff really attentive food served quickly . I'd recommend trying curry udon you're ok mildly spicy - pretty unique tasty . Drinks also fantastic (I got radish yuzu plum wine cocktail named Daikon it truly taste like radish without weird- actually really refreshing the yuzu). The ramen looked le exciting I'd say the yakitori better elsewhere (st mark); but overall I enjoyed everything I ordered would come back try menu item (maybe the dragon ball next time).,4.0 star rating
1722,18,Wifey I celebrate midweek hump day date night . I surprised by taking here--love yakitori Japanese food general . I must say decides whernext time'll tough act follow. (!)

They offer reservation; definitely check out. (!) VALUE: Pricewise; I'm happy everything got . Nothing seemed egregiously overpriced; fact's I loved it . I've had yakitori when I lived SoCal I never felt satisfied I've felt nonono. (!) AMBIANCE: It's a nice date place .

1723,18,"This place only week new; I think're still adjusting their immediate popularity . The food came quickly; service prompt friendly; everything cooked prepared well - mealn't amaze enough felt desire drag other friend experience food . Despite; great time; may give place another chance few month . It's definitely worth visiting; high ceiling give rare feeling space; despite seated closely other patron``bar""- there definitely stand dish warrant try.Basil: basil; strawberry; nigori sake - hoped would fruitier cocktail; drink leaned heavily herb note . If prefer fresher green cocktail; might . Daikon: radish; yuzu; plum wine - didn't love (maybe since couldn't get drinking something daikon flavored). It tart; bit vinegary; trouble tasting plum wine yuzu.Shiso: shiso; lemon; sake - dark horse drink evening . I'm usually note huge fan shiso; blended lemon; lovely tart fresh cocktail I very much enjoyed.Chicken Oyster Skewer - This star evening; drop; sure order skewer these; juicy; flavorful tender - unanimously voted best part the evening.Daichi Mushroom: grilled mushroom scallop basil sauce - worth ordering; the sauce the perfect topping the meaty mushrooms.Kara Age: pretty standard Japanese fried chicken; the bone . I had sprinkle shichimi give little oomph.Tori Liver Pate: is nothing like the fatty creamy pate generally come mind ;'s leaner pate heavy iron flavor ;'s thick . This felt almost like healthy substitution standard pate; decent; I could skip without longing.Zuke Maguro: marinated tuna sashimi fresh jalapeno sauce; while the version received pallid cousin the image the menu; the combination the jalapeno sauce the tuna fresh lovely . Teba Gyoza: chicken wing pork dumpling stuffing - This is one the must order dish; I mean stuffed dumpling stuffing chicken wing - would star my dream superbowl party.Dragon Ball: grilled beef; tofu sauce & quail egg - one the flavorful dish the night; none u would complained had just bed rice meal.Meatball - pretty standard; juicy; flavorful; memorable . Eel: egg; fish flake cucumber -visually lovely; bit a miss u . It wa a little sweet; sugar causing a grainy texture the underside . It wa a little difficult eat the egg strip awkwardly dropped top; we decided we'd definitely skip return visits.Kinoko Cream: chicken thigh; mushroom sauce; creamy truffle sauce - reminded chicken a campbell's cream mushroom sauce (a good way). We enjoyed; found the truffle flavor nearly nonexistent.Ichigo Salad: mixed green salad strawberry sauce - a nice mix green; walnut; freeze dried strawberry; we actually enjoyed's sweet strawberry dressing; I wouldn't mind throwing grilled chicken this lunch.Nasu Dengaku: deep fried eggplant miso; nut scallion . I'm generally not eggplant fan; my fellow patron found this a decent version they wouldn't mind partaking again.Kinoko X3 +1 : 3 type mushroom charred + 1 a soy based sauce - we definitely enjoyed the charred flavor; gave u outdoor bbq feel on a rainy night.Duck Ankake: grilled duck fermented miso scallion - the flavor wa great; the duck could been a bit tender; we did enjoy the wasabi cream on it though.Tamago Bacon: pretty basic; soft boiled egg; wrapped bacon; sprinkled truffle salt . We agreed we'd quite enjoy this for breakfast - someone else made it for u regularly.Yuzu Sorbet: This wa the best way end a heavy meal; I wouldn't mind stashing a few these my freezer counter the exhausting heat summer days.Kuro Goma: Black Sesame panna cotta; ice cream biscuit - I enjoyed the creamy texture the panna cotta the toasty flavor the black sesame ice creamSuishingen: rain drop pudding with bean powder kuromitsu sauce - an absolutely gorgeous dessert tasted like a simple sugar jelly . Beautiful order; not favorite dessert to taste; if you're a fan of simple traditional dessert; this may be better suited to you.All all; we had a wonderful time; definitely think it's worth a visit; though the moment I prefer Izakaya Mew Nonono.",3.0 star rating
1724,18,Came Friday night had wait around 30-40 min - it's New York nothing surprising.We ordered squid kara age appetizer share - were really good . I loved sauce came squid chicken fried well - oily/too much batter.I got rainbow roll good; nothing too special . They drizzled olive oil on; I thought interesting . We also shared the curry udon ramen . The ramen wa okay; are definitely a lot better place; I loved the udon - creamy a kick spiciness,4.0 star rating
1725,18,This place $$ $absolutely fantastic worth try . Nonono new yakitori place Nomad incredibly creative dish . The restaurant developed folk created Her name Han head chef designed Nonono menu came Izakaya Mew - know place good! I went high expectation still impressed . Each dish intricately put together flavorful novel mix flavor; texture color - obvious chef put a lot thought plate.All dish small . ALL OF THEM . Between two people; ordered 6 small dish 4 piece yakitori . So maybe keep small size dish mind order youn't end harassing staff ordering each time passed . The dish might $18 still tiny . A couple highlight: - First; yakitori: use every part chicken they a nice (albeit uncomfortably placed) diagram a chicken prove . Cartilage great . Skin crispy; flavorful everything you've ever wanted chicken skin . Chicken tail oddly chewy . -Dragon ball: This dope . It marinated beef a peanut sauce quail egg onion . The beef tender tasted absolutely amazing the sauce . This umami heaven . If you only order one dish; order one . -Nori tofu: Tofu; soy sauce; avocado nori a dash wasabi the nori . It spicy; sweet; sour salty . My brain confused it a great combination tasted amazing.-Duck Nanban: This deep fried duck egg salad a soy sauce . The egg salad a complete disappointment (it wa onion a creamy sauce) the combination the savory crispy fried duck; the cold creamy egg salad; the salty soy sauce made the dish very different very interesting . -Teba Gyoza: This four chicken wing each stuff pork dumpling . Really interesting concept still trying wrap head around they managed stuff a dumpling a chicken wing . Delicious very different what I've before . -Sesame panna cotta sesame ice cream: The panna cotta wa alright; the ice cream wa AMAAAAAZING . I practically inhaled the ice creamRegarding drink; the Shiso great taste like spiked lemonade . Highly recommend . Overall; is amazing restaurant . If I come again; I would come a big group people and order dish . We ordered many plate only two people; there still so many creative and interesting dish want to try . I look forward to returning!,5.0 star rating
1726,18,We came large group; I personally tried Thigh Short rib w/ onion skewer; also Shoyu Chintan.The ramen a bit small .

The skewer definitely worth trying; were good.In general; food portion a bit small; I'd suggest getting skewer your meal.,4.0 star rating
1727,18,Amazing cocktail; food little hit miss . I loved daikon cocktail - blended subtle flavor daikon ume well; I almost ready order second one . Food: Nasu dengaku/grilled eggplant - probably most interesting . Topped walnut; good balance sweet savory . 10/10 would order againBroiled chicken skin - wa surprisingly refreshing light side grated daikon ponzu sauceTori liver pate - I love chicken liver pate wa hit me; although I can't say wa much better/worse most pate I've . Generous portionsSkewers - got chicken oyster (super tender; mediocre flavor); pork ponzu (bit tougher side); shishito pepper; shishamo . All good; nothing amazing hereDuck nanban - really fan one; this basically tasted like orange chickenYaki mentaiko - this wa really interesting the wasabi mayo; helped cut the saltinessCreamy curry udon - waaay creamy me; wa a literal layer white cream top of the udon Overall; a solid meal; especially the cocktail . Would definitely come back try of the drink.,4.0 star rating
1728,18,I came Friday night friend; seated within 5-10 minute (probably around 7pm); larger group a significant wait.Food: The 2 u shared salmon tataki; kinoko; zuke masago; nonono kara age . Wen't super hungry; good portion pretty small . Everything delicious -'s hard pick one favorite! The kinoko we ordered based a recommendation; we pleasantly surprised how delicious seemingly plain grilled mushroom could . Service: Excellent service; helpful the menu; attentive server.Ambience: bad; not quite nice you'd expect based on the food/prices; I'm guessing the place usually packed it when I wa here.Overall: pretty solid food; lot more dish I'd like try; I'll have to come back!,5.0 star rating
1729,18,Caught with friend . Knew I made reservation waited little an hr 7pm Friday . We got seated around 8:10-15 ish.The food didnt come quickly I wanted.... seemed super busy .

We ordered a ton takatori skewer; dragon ball; duck ankake; teba gyoza (wing); kara shoyu (ramen).Not a fan skewer in general I won't comment them . The dragon ball; wing; ramen all mediocre - I've better other place . The thing I truly enjoyed the duck ankake . It definitely high quality meat . In general; the ambiance great; service wa quick; all the ingredient fresh high quality . In't know it wa the lack seasoning the dish up par taste wise.,3.0 star rating
1731,18,I'm giving 4 star primarily ambience . We walked around 6:15pm Saturday got seated right away no reservation . The space beautiful ha second floor overlooking first.Everything the menu looked delicious . We ordered a few yakitori item; the curry udon; squid; salmon belly .

Wish I'd come people I could eaten more; is definitely a place sharing exploring much the menu possible . Will definitely go back next time I'm New York.,4.0 star rating
1733,18,eggghhh.A precious izakaya people have ever seen izakayas western magazine . It's comfortable a hipster-y way; yet sterile Applebee's others.There's interesting dish; image-sizing lens trickery make everything look 1.5x size actually . It immensely frustrating try share dish friend . You can't feel good eating whatever's front ordering if are still hungry; ordering two something front.Solving problem would probably important my mind . If are trying make izakayas accessible a tasting menu / upscale set; it be possible order dish scaled the number people are going share it.If you care all izakayas; skip nonono go to a cozier; smaller; cheaper; slightly chaotic place . For example; the upscale range; Azasu the best mix the desirable attribute izakayas the polished presentation of more expensive place.,2.0 star rating

1747,18,Great interior design! It's really simplistic comfortable . Came Friday night date night around 6:30 were seated right away; however; must note way around 7 something large line . So come early! This place really organic feel food . We reallyn't know get ordered lot small plate randomly . First salmon tataki- yummy very tender . You get lot salmon wa unexpected! The salmon on bed avocado great sauce pairing . Not going lie I almost wa full trying finish off . We also ordered uni carpaccio (on little scallop). I'm huge fan seawater tasting thing wa really fresh didn't any sea smell taste! Also come with lot . We ordered one skewer chicken liver wa good super seasoned . For healthy veggie option we ordered mushroom plate (Kinoko) were beautifully grilled it super natural state; so they basicallyn't taste; BUT small dish seasoned enoki mushroom grab little bit eat with rest mushroom . Tebasaki Gyoza- super juicy ;'s crispy since's fried (like Koreans). These have pork stuffing . I ordered creamy curry udon solely novelty since I've seen before . The mashed potato cream on top not thick mashed potato cream . If you mix it with the curry it'll simply disappear . The curry udon ha a lot sauce no meat/veggies it . It ha a good curry kick it . Only eat this a a shareable carbohydrate; not a a one person meal . In fact forgot say; share everything . Sui shingen/ water cake is good simple; and also the black sesame panna cotta . Both good dessert to end the meal!,5.0 star rating
1748,18,We reservation Sat night; seated upstairs . The restaurant really cool feel . Hard describe; I dig! First; item really wanted try ran; like chicken oyster nonono Karage; huge bummer; because that; decided order Teba Gyoza; wa pretty mindblowing . It essentially chicken wing stuffed gyoza filling . The chicken wing cooked grill skin ha soy glaze flavor . Oh ;'s boneless even though look like regular chicken wing! None that chicken nugget crap place called boneless wing . We ordered variety yakitori share . All were very tasty! Wen't venture unique item though.For veggie; favorite wa Kinoko x 3+1; is variety grilled mushroom an enoki mushroom dipping sauce . Really liked the Grilled Romaine also well the Corn . I also insisted order the Anchovies Edamame I got some look the table; I think lot people liked; didn't want admit! We also tried the Nanchatte Steak; is rib eye an onion dressing; the Cream Curry Udon . For the steak; I think skip; I think for the udon; you fan really creamy item; it's must . I thought it wa bit the top; although it wa tasty! It can be a bit pricey; we a group 5 we got try share a lot of different thing . No problem service; although they did try rush u a bit towards the end.,4.0 star rating
1749,18,Great drink; okay service; not great value . Our meal came around $100 2; we definitelyn't full! They're based around small plate skewer; fine; only of skewer really wowed (short rib good; chicken alright). The fried rice dish just average home style dish . The sashimi plate quite good fresh; $18 platter . Everything else bit forgettable . (We ordered sashimi platter; short rib skewer onion; pork ponzu; chicken thigh skewer; steak; fried rice; drink). The steak okay . Also; took a bit even first skewer appetizer to come . But; like I said; drink menu really interesting - I strawberry basil drink it wa really refreshing . Would interested coming for the drink.,3.0 star rating

1751,18,Since yelpn't give .5 star; I would've given Nonono 3.5 star . The restaurant feel like more upscale izakaya . Ambiance great service good . The menu extensive . My boyfriend I ordered few skewer; duck dish sashimi appetizer . Everything good not great . The skewer all seasoned . Overall great new restaurant try foodn't memorable.,3.0 star rating
1752,18,Highly recommend visit try a group friend . I appreciated environmentn't loud dining area spacious . On experience; small dish serving restaurant typically loud a bit cramped . nonono specializes serving izakaya like menu dish includes yakitoro other appetizer-like dishes.I'd recommend ordering 3-4 dish per person then order depending how full feel . The portion finished 1-2 bite . Of course have entree ranging rice dish noodle I think ordering small dish allow you taste experience variety the menu . Definitely recommend the yakitori (skewer) specifically the skewer; the short rib the skirt steak . The meat very tender cooked perfection . Everything well seasoned my taste nothing either salty too sweet . Will definitely back! Hope that nonono keep producing consistent dish like I today continues focus the quality/taste rather quantity.,5.0 star rating
1753,18,( Dec 2018) Came friend's birthday around 7pm left happy belly . It definitely more contemporary Japanese restaurant some hipster feel . We ordered Basil Daikon drink ($ 12); pretty light sweet . We also ordered scallop ($ 6); lime cilantro ($ 4.50); eel ($ 6); tomato salmon ($ 4.50) yakitori . All of them above average I think bit overcooked portion small . In addition; we ordered salmon tataki ($ 11); nonono karaage (4pcs for $12); ika yaki ($ 10); saba oni roll ($ 10); creamy curry udon ($ 13). My personal favorite are the salmon tataki guacamole (yes; first I thought it wasabi too) it freshly served a cold plate the nonono karaage it wa very crispy flavor . Creamy curry udon pretty strong thick flavor definitely would recommend sharing . HH (beer) are from 5-7pm . Recommend!,4.0 star rating
1754,18,"Visually; Nonono pretty would make beautiful date night spot . Unfortunately; In't impressed food.On logistical note ;n't take reservation phone only take reservation Resy 5; 5:30; 9; 9:30pm . Things I impressed: + The beautiful interior restaurant+ Illustrated menu (getting preview food look like the best!) + Salmon tataki ($ 11) - The seared salmon melt-in-your-mouth delicious . (The avocado sauce just okay --n't scraping off the plate the salmon done .) Things I felt neutral (would consider reordering): + Kinoko x 3 + 1 ($ 8) - I lovelovelove some mushroom . The soy-based mushroom sauce went well the otherwise unseasoned assorted charred mushroom . Also; the name the dish kinda fun . + Dragon Ball ($ 12) - This dish grilled thinly-sliced beef quail egg (I'm guessing soy-based)``signature tofu sauce""similar flavor profile the mushroom one . For dish; I would've happier eating over a bowl rice calling a day . In't think I would've enjoyed either their a much wen't the ramen carb up.+ Shio Paitan ($ 13) - I would've liked more theren't tiny chopped raw onion floating around--that's easy fix next time . The flavor the salt-based milky chicken broth very tasty rich both my friend I were a little busy trying avoid the tiny onion piece enjoy the broth . The noodle a nice; chewy bite them the chicken incredibly tender (reminded sou vide chicken).Things I not impressed: - Scallop takitori skewer ($ 6) - Three small; bland; overcooked scallops.- Duck ankake ($ 13) - The grilled duck a little tough; not atrociously so . I feel kind of neutral I wouldn't order again.Conclusion: If a friend wanted come eat here; I would happily revisit; I don't foresee suggesting it.",3.0 star rating

1756,18,Dinner 2 Tuesday evening without reservation we seated immediately bar . Overall service impeccable; ambiance/ branding super nice (new age Japanese yakitori bar) food wise...We ordered yakitori share - - chicken liver so puny! It almost skinny portion my chopstick! C'mon! (ref picture) - meatball good size marinated well- gyu tongue really tough good other yakitori place city- forgot other yakitori it (dark colored) pepper sauce it - okay . zuke maguro good since jalapeño sauce gave maguro right kick Duck ankake really underwhelming . Itn't grilled well; laid atop a sticky sauce bed spring onion nothing the dish...We also tried the spicy ramen - not worth the hype Although noodle very AldenteFor a date night of the ambiance branding; the novelty service - sure . But the value The food quality...I'll heading other place my Japanese food fix.,3.0 star rating
1757,18,Nonono similar concept Izakaya Mew Japanese izakaya twist . To get full experience; ordered few skewer some small dish . We ordered following: -Basil cocktail: Basically tasted like strawberry juice hint basil . Didn't get very buzzed.-Skirt meat skewer: Wasn't fan my friend enjoyed . It like tougher; fattier piece thigh meat.-Kinoko cream skewer: If like cream chicken ;'ll love! Especially with hint truffle! -Yuzukoshu nori skewer: This yummy! A nice blend yuzu nori flavor . -Beef tataki: Skip . Good not interesting.-Hamakama Nikomi: This very tasty; especially since I love fish collar they cooked well . However; would been a lot better saucen't salty . -Nonono kara age: Skip . Good just like other fried chicken . I like that they kept bone and scraped the meat one side . It a like a kara age lollipop.-Cream curry udon: This the best dish of the night! This the reason I would return! Overall; Nonono good not mind blowing . Some dish better others . Similar Izakaya Mew; I one dish that keep coming back more!,3.0 star rating
1758,18,I'm always skeptical yakitori place sometimes I can't justify spending much small skewer stick tapa . The yakitorin't pricey they definitely add . Izakaya place tend be little steeper price relative size; nonono definitely offered great experience well worth cost . My group tried several yakitoris; what stood to most chicken oyster (most people recommended) the chicken gizzard . I highly recommend ordering . The chicken oyster tender juicy! I most surprised the tamago bacon yakitori! Presentation beautiful the flavor surprised pleasantly well . I would recommend a well~ Ambiance soothing very chill . I loved the decor!

1787,18,As disclaimer; I work traditional izakaya; Yopparai . However; I very much enjoy experience . This place much comfortable younger people; though still bit expensive (sampling racked $60 pre-tip) Strengths:1 . The skewer came quite clean tasting - chicken skin Village Yokocho perhaps flavorful; one came crisp airy.2 . The dish presented modern plating; reminiscent some good Korean gastropubs around the area . As a cook; I'd prefer style too.3 . The general ambience much cleaner modern compared some others I've to.Weaknesses:1 . The menu good visuals; assumes the average customer not Japanese speaking . It would've nice see more romanji the menu.2 . The staff; though earnest; seemed a little disorganized (three people asked I ready order). Maybe zone strategy would effective? One server gave shichimi I asked karashi.,4.0 star rating

1789,18,Came hungry group 7; able order almost everything menu . I'm glad I came group; food delicious! Making reservation online their website easy (I recommend large group). We came Thursday night; restaurant never got really full; I imagine's difficult get seated walk in.First all; definitely try yakitori . The yakitori probably one best I've U.S.; since order per stick; won't feel stuck something may enjoy . Definitely get comfort zone; try interesting combinations.My favorite yakitori skirt meat shishito (meat really delicious quite filling). I thought yuzukosho nori little weird (n't enjoy nori grill meat) still good . If like chicken skin; definitely get skin yakitori.For drink; shared a bottle sake (genuine king). All my colleague enjoyed complimented . For small plate; ordered:1 . Beef tataki - really delicious grilled beef . High quality . Would order again2 . Salmon tataki . We ordered 2 these . Then we ordered 2 more . My colleague loved . I personally prefer beef salmon; like salmon; amazing dish.3 . Zuke maguro (tuna). We liked; In't think's unique enough a flavor order order a limited number dish . I lucky enough come such a large group we could try anything.4 . Tori liver pate . This super tasty! I also appreciated bread perfectly toasted . It came pickled ginger went pretty well the pate (maybe's I loved pickled ginger).5 . Scallop uni carpaccio . The scallop uni were fresh! I've noticed that uni dish become very popular NYC; at a lot place; the uni would a slight bitterness . The uni creamy no hint bitterness! I would definitely order just the freshness.6 . Duck Nanban (fried duck). This probably the group's favorite . We ordered 3 these . Personally; I wished wa crispier ;'s definitely something won't regret ordering.7 . Farm potato . Really good fry . The plate huge! Though you may want save the stomach space something else.8 . Grilled Romaine . Surprisingly one my favorite the night! It take like salad; go perfectly all the dish's cold . I really love dish would recommend if you want vegetable go all the meat dishes.9 . Corn . This wa tasty I wouldn't order with all the other choice . 10 . Dragon ball . The flavor wa good; I think if you want beef; spend money the skirt steak yakitori . This beef is pretty thin sliced wa smaller expected.11 . Duck ankake . Personally I preferred over the fried duck; I think it depends your preference sweet/fried grilled/creamy/salty.12 . Teba gyoza (chicken wing). We got like 4 order of this - I think mostly because it's chicken wing; most people like chicken wing . In't think it wa an unique enough offering warrant ordering this; it's definitely tasty.All in all; order yakitori and of the seafood duck dish . Then come again to try some other dish . I'm definitely coming back.,5.0 star rating

That said; I've plenty better soup dumpling elsewhere; I've rarely that were cheaper.We to wait 20 minute a table; In't think it's worth any longer a wait .

We arrived around 7pm; 2 people only wait 3 0 minute; not bad wait all . Also something note; the table communal style; it kinda add to the experience of dining . We also the chicken broccoli the veggie fried rice . Both delicious . But want soup dumpling; you must go; better spot NYC them.,5.0 star rating
1831,19,Every six month I go Joe's . It like strong tug my craving; especially weather get bit chilly city seems kind quiet . I especially love quiet Sunday no wait . Just perfection . Once seated (whether waited 30 min; 10 not all); notice are not always private table . A party two often split a round table another couple two . It definitely give a different atmosphere most the time everyone too focused their delicious meal care stuffing face . We normally spilt order dumpling an order fried rice . The dumpling a great flavor . The fried rice not oily salted . They come quickly are usually extremely hot . I would assume you probably will not have tastebud the remainder the day so make sure you order a nice cold beer wash all . But man; it is exactly the thing you needed to satiate the hunger inside.,4.0 star rating

There's very big difference homemade Chinese food restaurant food - whether it's the MSG oil extra salt add; In't know . But Fishmarket taste like real mother made the food . And the Mama; old Asian lady; came the back the kitchen I KNOW exists!! While the interior leaf to desired (fix the bathroom door please!); place perfect dinner drink work . Expect cheap drink; tasty; authentic food; good service.,5.0 star rating
1878,20,8/10 This place hard figure - look like dingy; dive bar drink served plastic cup probablyn't try food; let alone use restroom . Is attempt being hipster ironic? Or ruse keep New York elite maintain local charm? Regardless intent; food point atmosphere is exciting charming it way . The seafoodn't disappoint; I enjoyed Asian inspired fair (try stuffed eggplant!). The fish chip perfect . The owner wander around are focused keeping the mood high - I at least 2 shot Jameson the owner of plastic shot glass (hard love place free drink!). I'd definitely come back try seafood item . It's bit rowdy I probably would go the earlier side group to make sure you have table . It's the kind of place friend drink beer all night the noise level get a bit high . Come early dinner late drink.,4.0 star rating
1879,20,Dont let exterior/interior fool...place gem . My friend brought here a mini high school get together we all impressed food .

1887,20,When look place; doen't look attractive; peak window look dark dull inside . One window front cracked . There construction nearby building; not would expect place good food . The layout restaurant quite interesting; are stool spot; bar; small table few large table . The menu a variety item american food Asian fusion . My friend I opted Asian fusion: Stuffed eggplant $12 - I think came 6 piece stuffed some sort shrimp/fish paste . This very flavorful since eggplant one my favorite; this spot . Sea bass steak (bone) $38 market price - grilled not fishy all; come some kind soy sauce . A bit pricey it tasted good . Mama's curried chicken $13 - curry sauce different the traditional curry sauce you would find . It quite a spicy kick it the sauce is great the rice.While I observing going in the restaurant; the owner wa going around all the table offering free Jameson shot; always had a smile his face checked u see the food wa good . One the waiter even asked u did the curried chicken dish taste customer sat the table next u contemplating the dish; wa quite unique we were the basis decision; pressure on .

1894,20,I walked past Fishmarket trying find! Very unassuming spot.My visit week ago a Wednesday 6pm . We first one place actually filled soon despite being a rainy; dreary day.The menu consists a ton comfort food I love excited try--Scallion pancake--thin crispy . I usually prefer scallion pancake have chew but these still satisfying . Curried Chicken--best curry ever . I prefer curry thicker super spicy not disappoint . The chicken wa so tender potato atop crispy! Fish Tacos--wa least favorite dish the evening . The fish taco loaded slaw each contained 3 popcorn sized fish piece each . The fry also soggy.Crispy fried Rice--the favorite the night! I've never fried rice quite like . Each bite crispy bit! If're like like scrape the bottom clay pot rice bibimbaps; totally order this! Prices were on point . Service wa fine . They even offered u shot of Jameson before we left . I'd come back a heartbeat try item of course curried chicken and fried rice!,4.0 star rating
1895,20,This place easy be missed . The broken glass door mistaken u closed . Inside the restaurant; everything looked very old fashioned . Not many people there one windy Tuesday night . Most them sitting the bar.Three u ordered ginger wing; mama's curry chicken; oyster fish taco . Everything tasted great an Asian twist . Curry chicken a kick . My favorite wa the ginger wing; wa crispy; gingery tender . Wen't able finish everything.,4.0 star rating
1896,20,Unbelievable bar . But picture slightly kilter . We got free shot; management so friendly; i can't get these God forsaken picture . I furious my bone.,4.0 star rating
1897,20,This place good; I find little bit strange everyone loven't any issue pricing/portion size . I agree other yelpers' review respect restaurant/bar's completely unassuming look it fantastic flavor; portion size really disappointed . Still; four star justified owner/server friendly actually came around twice poured (small) shot Jameson house; actually drank u! We an order ginger wing ($ 11); mama's curried chicken ($ 13); pork belly meal ($ 12); chicken spicy string bean ($ 12). The wing possibly most disappointing food order the night: though crispy; the garlic flavor overwhelming I just didn't really enjoy . There good amount wing; though; that nice . Mama's curried chicken delicious; the meat tender there great; spicy curry flavor . In't think spicy other yelpers said; certainly a kick.The pork belly meal also amazing . (Well; the pork belly . The bok choy wa very standard .) The meat quite literally melt your mouth; again; the portion sized really too small! There only six small piece pork belly; that wa quite sad . Finally; the spicy string bean really pretty good; also very; very spicy . The bean the chicken went together well; I would probably try another dish I to return.Overall I a good time; we split it by three each paid $21.50 and I left a little unsatisfied . Great flavor not enough food the money!,4.0 star rating
1898,20,One gem South Street Seaport . Fishmarket family owned; down-to-earth chill restaurant / dive bar embrace it customer warmth hospitality . The owner' mom run kitchen; perfecting home recipe creative; fusion-inspired addition . I came with huge group basically tried every famous dish menu . I recommend the garlic chicken wing; spicy shrimp noodle; the fried cod 100% . The flavor authentic spicy well . The owner are incredibly sweet; constantly passing customer free Jameson shot . Mama the kitchen take the shot! This overall a very fun tasty restaurant's also perfect those love alcohol.,5.0 star rating

1900,20,This really intriguing place . Think part dive bar; part seafood (like calamari; lobster roll; etc); part Asian cuisine . It dark; grungy feel casual; fun place catch a couple friend . We went dinner a Friday night got when opened evening; it wan't crowded . By time left though; table filled . The memorable dish probably just what the other Yelpers brought: the pork belly bowl curried chicken . Both good with rice . Decent place grab a bite hanging with friend (a couple drink); I wouldn't go of way it.,3.0 star rating
1901,20,Just left In't want go! The food amazing! We got crispy rice sausage; shrimp dumpling; shrimp chip; garlic shrimp . Everything delicious . We also got free Jameson shot! The people work definitely know to run good business keep customer coming back!!!!,5.0 star rating
1902,20,So I told place my friend Jocelyn K time much loved place . She super eager try went few week back . This place super unique; look front; basically looked like ho hum divey bar . Once inside; ha typical bar setup bar left high table right; get back basic setup restaurant . When look menu though; get super duper Asian/Malaysian; I like heck? But good thing Asian food solid . My favorite part seeing mom come kitchen pink kitchen apron . lol During dinner; owner came said hey; let's take group shot Jameson . So gave u some free shot we took the owner . =) The food: Mama's Curried Chicken- This my favorite dish the night . The chicken curry made really well; I really enjoyed the overall flavor I enjoyed the level spice . It spicy make sure you are aware hand . I Thai; if I say pack punch; pack punch . I also; really enjoyed the potato absorbed lot that curry goodness; I say this is a must order . yelp.com/user_local_phot…Crispy Fried Rice with Sausage- I normally frown ordering fried rice an Asian restaurant the one made really well . I really enjoyed the flavor; the texture the rice I really enjoyed the fried crunchies put the top . yelp.com/user_local_phot…Drunken Fish Soup- The fish soup nice comforting . It come served a little pot I like that it is lit the bottom so every time you get; it is still hot . I enjoyed the texture of the fish and the broth good it kinda simple me . I guess a Thai I wa expecting to a little punch the flavor department . yelp.com/user_local_phot…Yummy Noodles- I thought this wa OK; I felt the noodle kinda lifeless and should have been softer . I also wish some of the sauce absorbed the noodle . yelp.com/user_local_phot…,4.0 star rating
1903,20,So divey; chill; yum . My bf I looking relaxing spot have quick bite drink; stumbled upon Malaysian bar . Its super Americanized; cooking spectacular- like asian auntie whipped amazing Malaysian American fusion meal . Ginger chicken wing freakin amazing; is super fried rice (took leftover home heated well next day). We learned wa mother son team- mother would cook the kitchen her son would man the bar . Love! The 2 issue I would definitely point is--1. avoid bar seating closest the door . My boyfriend a uncomfortable experience- ended with 20 mosquito bite his leg! Poor thing . Its a really dark corner; I guess mosquito thrive . Avoid!! Find a seat closer the light . 2 . On the the way back; I realized they forgot serve bok choy order . Unclear charged it since we paid left quickly avoid bug bite . Would've a perfect experience not those two issue . I would consider coming back giving another shot though.,4.0 star rating
1904,20,Not best restaurant; food nothing special definitely not 4.5 star . People rave food actually look kitchen's next the bathroom?! Lol Look the picture posted . Very dirty not clean . Also yeah Free shot Jameson most people not whisky drinker so they wouldn't able tell's legit Jameson's; highly believe's another liquor the bottle . Ifn't believe ask this: bar sustain by always giving round free shot everyday every day the week? don't believe the hype! I gave 5 star bc I rated one star; it would gotten pushed back aka lost all the fake as (brought) review . If can buy IG twitter follower lol can also buy good as yelp review.,5.0 star rating

1907,20,One favorite place FiDi! The food sooooo good really speaks itself . If're coming get drink ;'re really missing!!! Standouts: - crispy fried rice: crispy every bite; I'm huge fried rice fan cause get bland; awesome great stand alone entree - spicy curry chicken: favorite thing -'s actually spicy flavor permeates chicken . They also use fave cut chicken: superior dark meat.- pork belly pot: melt ur mouth fatty goodness; sitting delicate bed bok choy u r disgusting person eating pork belly - wing: generous portion awesome! I've regular buffalo ginger loved . - food this place family owned: love vibe; sometimes owner walk around free Jameson shot!!!! (I partaken great enjoyment I not a saint hehehe) My two problem this place 1) crowd get kinda rowdy restaurant can be crowded loud 2) entree price a little pricey side - make sense given area - the price stop from coming much I would want: (Wanted end my review a quick story: I feeling a bit the weather still wanted catch with a friend . I ordered the drunken fish soup (flavorful gingery - perfect a cold) asked I could add bok choy to the soup (bc I'm a huge baby need vegetable otherwise I die). Initially I told couldn't that; one second later told could . When brought the food; I thought the bok choy would just added to the soup boiled (I would have enjoyed course!) BUT instead they literally cooked another side bok choy added crispy onion top . It amazing! The bok choy wa flavorful fresh; the crispy onion added this great salty note texture . Theyn't even charge! Ugh! So nice! Thank u fish market making sure I get my green!!!!,4.0 star rating

1910,20,I looking seafood dinner; specifically oyster; seaport area found Fishmarket Yelp . The dish looked unique delicious page excellent review . I read menu going friend last week noticed many menu item an Asian twist . Based all excellent review various item choose the menu; decided go . When arrived Fishmarket kind looked closed/dingy the outside . We walked fun/happening environment . The bartender looked u knew first time . We walked crowded bar area pretty loud music group people drinking towards table the back the restaurant . The restaurant definitely the divey side; could immediately tell a hidden gem . The bartender/waiter came u wa super friendly . Right we placed drink food order; the bartender walked every table the restaurant gave person a shot Jameson take together . My friend & I no clue wa going on; went it . We ended ordering a dozen oyster; steamed pork dumpling; fried rice sausage . All the food wa excellent! I specifically loved the rice . It wa so delicious unlike other fried rice I've . After experience Fishmarket; I tell place special caters to all type people . There wa a family appreciating the eclectic asian dish; younger people drinking happy hour; and a bunch group enjoying dinner . Highly recommend trying Fishmarket you're the seaport area . Looking forward to going back soon!,5.0 star rating

The wing perfectly crispy - came a delicious sauce - eggplant divine . Omg . Then shared stuffed cod (tasty sizable); the fish taco (good they get; luckily; too overly rich...fresh); the pork belly pot (mouthwatering...I couldn't get enough the sauce) their famous crispy fried rice sausage (very crispy indeed; flavorful). Everything got perfectly executed very very good . Once Adam gone; Jeff - another super friendly welcoming guy - kept making sure happy . We were wowed the outstanding service; always attentive caring . Adam's Jeff's mom is the star the show; creating one fantastic dish the . Next time I meet! $16 lobster special Monday Tuesday Wednesday; fresh oyster Saturday Sunday . They often offer free Jameson shot to built a convivial familiar atmosphere...priceless .

1931,20,TL; DR: Unassuming Bar/Restaurant Asian American Dish . Solid food service . Drunken fish soup FTW! Fishmarket Restaurant typical American/seafood restaurant'd expect see district like waterfront area.First; little hard spot entrance . The door knob little lower average door knob placement - there good minute I kept searching entrance door walking front restaurant.. made look like stalker..lolSecondly; place hardly upscale/modern space . It dim dark even lightning; you could notice decoration pretty minimal . The table bar pretty standard type . The bathroom whole place also screaming update . But I guess owner feel secondary food service - course main reason people would coming backThirdly; menu . It's place serf American / seafood Asian (Malaysian?) comfort dish . They've got dish like Fish pescatore; fish taco; fish chip; pasta dish are very Western influenced they've also got thing like Chicken curry; fish soup; fried rice are Asian influenced . Based review look like quality food pretty solid across board . Fortunately also applies dish I tried well . I got drunken fish soup extra rice noodle the ginger crispy wing . The drunken fish soup loaded lot ginger warms you inside . I guess's they called drunken soup? It supposed cure the drunkenness? But anyway; I couldn't stop slurping dish . I demolished blink eye (well..but exactly fast; an empty stomach cold weather like today certainly helped the case). This dish scream comfort BIG time somehow I still felt like eating food . Then; evil hungry mind somehow kept wandering the menu drawn toward the crispy ginger wing . My poor wallet disagreed turn event; too late since evil desire reigned . The wing definitely really tasty crispy; however I not quite able taste the ginger . I also not big fan the sweet chili sauce I a sucker Sriracha/ super hot hot sauce . Bonus point - the server really attentive gracious . He checked me periodically ensuring water is always full . He also offered a free shot! I not want it while I devouring the wing . The total soup wing tip wa $32 - a bit high of course you compare with Chinatown; considering the area I dining (i.e . Seaport/manhattan everything is somehow becoming triple/quadruple uber more expensive); this is a reasonable price . I look forward coming back again the future; hopefully next time in a group setting I allow hungry desire get more dish like the fried rice; the famous curry even the American dish! Or maybe I get meet the mama's owner I also heard a lovely person . Till - keep up the great work keep rocking!,4.0 star rating

1939,20,I Fishmarket bookmark . One Monday night; friend I looking place near office grab dinner; place came radar . We decided walk check out.The place bit divey . It's got damp basement feel; tables/seatsn't match . Even; decided order raw clam . I mean; place called fishmarket all . They tasted fine; though tad fishy; most them hard get shell . Not great sign probably good idea order raw food a dive . Butn't end getting food poisoning anything; all good hood (trunk ...? haha...get? Dad joke). For entree; seemed most popular item fish taco crispy fried rice shrimp . The fish tacon't the best I've ever were pretty good . And $12 three taco fry ;'s a great deal! As the fried rice; I iffy ordering 1 . How good could . Not better authentic fried rice a place Chinatown; right? 2 . I'm normally a fan self-proclaimed Asian fusion place because're really fusion . It usually mean there a dish a bunch different Asian cuisine make particularly well . I can't speak the Asian dish on the menu the fried rice amazing . I liked a lot than I expected . They added extra ingredient there gave the dish a crispy element . Neither my friend I could figure; it tasted like the bottom later crispy rice scrape claypot rice dish . Plus; gave a good amount shrimp.There's drink menu; I did not like . I like know much I'm paying a drink . Three drink came $24 it wa pretty average . There no happy hour despite what Yelpers saying (maybe they used?) Theyn't any draft beer; but they have some bottle . So the menu issue would also resolve me pestering the bartender a few time the beer they have available . Speaking of the bartender; seemed really nice down to earth . He went around and took shot all of the customer . He treated u like were regular; even though had never even there . It's a nice feeling! Before left; already decided we'd be back to Fishmarket.,4.0 star rating

They could used bit salt . The marinara sauce a bit oily too chunky my taste . I also the yummy noodle ($ 8). The wide flat rice chopped served a malaysian curry sauce bit potato may not been bit French Fries . had a lot flavor spiciness . They some amazing crispy french fry .

Whole fried chicken- 2/5 . I'm sorry; ; no . I get's``sweet tea brined fried chicken""that wouldn't necessarily super crunchy . However; I expect the meat the least cooked . Long story short; the leg' meat pink super putting . If I'm paying $4/1 piece fried chicken at least cooked``the way""? This isn't burger . Buckwheat Cheddar Waffles- 3/5 . Slowly redeeming the awful chicken didn't stand way . No; bad; I not say great either . They also came little cold/cheese wan't fully melted.Mac n cheese- 5/5 . Mac n cheese to save the day! This side wa reasonably priced considering it's portion size wa pretty damn good . Yes it's mac n cheese trust; you go; get . The biscuit herb crust wa the``cherry top""me .

1965,21,This review long due; I'd doing restaurant disservice In't rate . I've come brunch twice restaurant week my friend I absolutely loved cuisine time! We made reservation get rather crowded space small; although annoying wait ~30 min sit even reservation . We then taken dining area; very beautiful rustic space . It's decorated bottle; plant; bone over the wall made u feel like were somewhere South Carolina . When sat; the friendly waiter gave u option choose explained wa included the restaurant week menu . To sum up; it wa delicious deviled egg were perfectly seasoned Cajun; heavenly Mac n cheese overflowed cheese; fried chicken waffle the entree (it wa oily for my taste); my favorite - savory rendition the watermelon had drizzle jalapeños . I'm still in disbelief chef create unique dish watermelon! All the dish be shared; I'd say is a great place to try family-style meal . We also got delicious drink were strong! My favorite wa the Tipsy cocktail beekeeper ($ 12). For ~ $70 a person; we left stuffed like a turkey and happy . Thank Root & Bone!,5.0 star rating
1966,21,Wow; I'm big fan fried chicken . I would consider fried chicken connoisseur (considering much fried chicken I eat a year; fact I order fried chicken anywhere ha on menu) fried chicken amazing . The portion huge BTW . My friend I ordered a considerable amount food thinking wouldn't get full entree . But; were wrong.When fried chicken came; I thought mistakenly given the large portion I ordered the small portion . The basket probably had 6 large piece fried chicken . The fried chicken savory tasted even amazing eaten their honey tabasco sauce . My friend ordered the braised short rib meatloaf shared the biscuit gravy the mac cheese . Everything we ordered pretty tasty; the fried chicken definitely stole the show . Luckily; we didn't wait long a table . I would love to come back brunch; have heard the wait impossible . Regardless; I be back the fried chicken!,4.0 star rating
1967,21,This my second time Root & Bone I'd doing disservice giving 5 star . Made brunch reservation Sundays ago (make sure book early; place pretty small get booked pretty quick). As soon walk door; smell delicious herb spice guide all way your seat . Service attentive we received menu; water; drink; etc . right away . Most food shared we ordered biscuit; whole chicken (n't worry; come piece everyone have a drumstick); grit; Mac cheese; biscuit gravy . Let tell; food amazing . The biscuit pretty flaky come some sort maple butter sauce drizzle dip . The chicken very well seasoned a great crunch exteriorn't greasy either (though In't think I'd complain it!). It brined ice tea you get the perfect faintest taste you take a bite . The Mac cheese perfectly cheesy a nice firm crust - use cavatappi I think the best way make 'macaroni' cheese . The gravy biscuit to die - rich creamy soft! I think the grit probably the least favorite the table . There lot corn much cheese; really not what you'd expect traditional southern style grit . We also got the apple tart; though I'm not sure we room; wa out this world good . Root & Bone is a brunch staple that everyone to try least . Trust; you won't be disappointed!,5.0 star rating

1978,21,I've long skeptical both brunch Southern food NYC; surprising turn event me both seek Root & Bone few Sundays ago absolutely love . It's exactly bougie; boozy fried chicken place I feared would; it it well.Our party two showed around noon without reservation told would about ten minute wait bar seat . We took walk around block it ready soon came back . Our bar seat ended being cozily tucked against photogenic bar well stocked whiskey mason jar anchored antler-topped beer taps.You're fried chicken; come plenty combination added offering; there reasonably varied list Southern-tinged alternative; like cheddar buckwheat waffle; shrimp grit; rhubarb-strawberry salad . There smaller plate side $10; larger dish run $15 up . They gluten-free option available; vegetarian can eat decently; everything look pretty nut-allergen friendly well.Between two u; we had heirloom tomato toast ($ 14) half sweet tea brined fried chicken ($ 19). The former tasty; juicy; flavorful tomato stuck to crispy toast nice homemade aioli . The pickled ramp were pleasant surprise.The fried chicken deserves own paragraph . It's served piping hot; crackly not assertive skin super-tender inside; not heavy . The lemon dusting positively addictive . Just a good bird all around . Would happily get it again even this inflated price.Service excellent; the meal relatively quick 45 minute . Decor atmosphere make even a casual lunch feel celebratory . No booze u; though have a nice selection classic cocktail brunch drink; well beer; cider; kombucha .

1979,21,I've come twice fried chicken waffle . The first time (few year ago) I remember loving; the recent time I different experience . I think I ordered something slightly different - fried chicken waffle with mac n cheese collard green the side . Huge portion - a bit much me . The waffle? They crispy; I'm a fan cheesy savory waffle . I prefer sweet . The fried chicken? I like they give the option white dark meat; I thought the chicken breast could've more tender flavorful . Maybe dark meat better...Anyway; I a little disappointed especially since I good memory my first visit . Nothing bad time around; I higher expectation.,3.0 star rating
1980,21,I've Root Bone three time; third time (last Saturday) unfortunately; worst (last) trip . The service great; however; food simply horrible .

I sadly not back.,2.0 star rating

1983,21,Root & Bone good Southern food; nothing standout . I came Thursday night dinner; left disappointed . While's very cute; cozy place; service terrible . It took waitress 30 minute come take order; very brusque entirety our meal . My friend I split side order macaroni; she ordered risotto; I ordered shrimp grit . I want preface saying foodn't bad ;n't great . While Root & Bone one pride on making simple ingredient taste great; I thought everything underwhelming . The macaroni fine ;n't anything special . While it wa pretty look photograph; it wa under-seasoned wa nothing ordinary . The shrimp grit better . The grit super creamy and full flavor . However; several of my shrimpn't deveined; wa definitely unpleasant surprise.If were half star allowed; I would give Root & Bone 3.5 star . While I've heard restaurant great brunch; there better place be dinner . For price pay for each dish; food isn't worth the cost.,3.0 star rating

The deviled egg fine (I'm huge deviled egg person; my friend enjoyed) the biscuit SO good . And's a vegetarian option the original recipe bacon it (I believe?); it great; a vegetarian; be able have option . The Benedict great even without the ham top; I could eat a million those waffle every day . The side salad a little unnecessary I felt bad wasting much it; it wa still good . We also got lavender lemonade wa super refreshing a little weak the lavender . I plan on coming back; I try of the side and menu!,5.0 star rating

1988,21,"Was looking brunch spot East Village Root & Bone* looked like appetizing place saved my bookmark . Apparently can make brunch reservation; rare In't even check see possibility . Upon arrival around 1:30 pm; told could eat outside (freezing) wait about 30 minute . The staff take phone number text when table ready; is really proper way handle wait restaurant . As turn; wait only 17 minute; we spent time watching Eagles game** bar nearby . Back R & B: We seated two barstools overlooking street also few patron opted eat outside; awkward we staring their food lot . The food is very 'grammable; is most food nowadays; I guess.So place super cute we enjoyed people watching whatever; food obvious highlight experience . I ordered fried chicken biscuit; served pepper jelly; few chip (the biscuit--weird) pickled veggie (pretty; served the side). Yeah; good kinda nut . The biscuit were about fluffy biscuit could; also salt-crusted crunchy top . The white-meat chicken tender; is so hard do . [Nobody want eat dry chicken; happens sometimes .] The pepper jelly wa sweet; tangy; savory . And the pickled veggie added eye-popping jolt flavor . There wa obviously lot going dish; it wa all done so much care nothing got lost the shuffle.We also tried the shrimp n grit (melted tomato pickled onion; corn; bacon beer jus); is seemingly the thing people get when don't get the fried chicken . Unsurprisingly; is heavy; buttery dish; is too complex nevertheless delicious . The pickled onion add exciting; unexpected element; whon't love corn? I could only taste a hint smoke the bacon jus.The one unfortunate aspect the meal wa that were out basically every coffee drink the menu except drip coffee . I ordered that; it wa on the weaker side; though served an attractive green mug . Also; Splenda . I love Splenda am going start a one-women Yelp crusade get restaurant serve Splenda everywhere . *Actual name of this restaurant . My boyfriend kept calling it``Rag Muffin"". What? No . I think wa joking I can't sure . **Blew a 17-point lead in the 4th quarter; fabulous job.",5.0 star rating

There apparently sort hype surrounding this place I unaware; after gone without mind; I still left (group me) feeling a bit let down.Service fine; everyone friendly attentive; least wait a to ask check empty plates.Beyond; food the main problem . Thingsn't taste good; portion odd; item didn't seem to match side term flavor texture.I the pulled pork good . Bun dry; pork chewy; really nothing the dish enjoyable . It seems most meal we tried resulted the feeling``did I just eat?""From the grit to the dessert .

2005,21,"Root Bone been my list couple year; pretty much when opened . When Gilt City offered deal couple month ago; I pull trigger . The scene pretty cool . It's kind mix modern industrial look white painted brick wall rich wood shelf bar over . The space little tight bar seating over adjacent all table; Monday night ;n't open seat house pack people waiting entrance seat open . You'll want / need reservation . The Gilt City deal insanely good value an obscenely large amount food . The Gilt City deal left lot food guilt; amount got . Drunken Deviled Eggs - loved . There something little pickley; little dilly; lot eggy . Just a really well executed dish . Gem Salad - I'll say something In't often say . This an awesome salad . There . I said . The combination sweet corn pickled onion the creamy ricotta the garlic vinaigrette really all combine one awesome salad . Angel Biscuits - fantastically executed biscuit . Moist; flaky; sweet; salty; buttery . They great on their; the chicken honey jus added an extra dimension's sweet savory; much like the biscuit . Fried Chicken Cheddar Waffles - a half order chicken a lot clucking chicken . The bird pressure fried come perfectly crispy juicy tender . The waffle a solid pairing the chicken; not quite memorable the chicken; filling . Mac Cheese - creamy cheesy macaroni . It's another well executed version the American classic . Collared Greens - well balanced dish tender bite savory ham cut the apple cider vinegar . Nice dish . Short Rib``Meatloaf""- wa the one miss the night me . I love the creativity dish; taking short rib; shredding forming into a loaf . In the literal sense; certainly a loaf meat; I feel like would been better just serving short rib . Shrimp Grits - creamy; lightly cheesy grit; speckled corn kernel; pickled onion; plump shrimp . This dish exactly want . Chocolate Pudding Key Lime Pie - chocolate pudding snack pack a chocolate mouse a baby; this chocolate pudding would that baby . The key lime pie a mini mason jar is tangy delicious a crunchy graham cracker crust the bottom . So overall; I wa really surprised how much I enjoyed nearly every aspect this meal . My suggestion? Go with the deviled egg; gem salad; fried chicken (sans waffle); biscuit; maybe shrimp grit you a larger appetite; and maybe just one side . All this food is excellent; god damn is this stick to your rib cooking . Resist the urge to overindulge . You'll enjoy the meal if you aren't stuffed silly.",5.0 star rating

The fried chickenn't good; super dry hard . The short rib meat loaf literally ;'s short rib stuffed loaf pan popped . It's sort like brick carnitas . The chicken pot pie truly disgusting; with almost completely uncooked biscuit top . The top biscuit looked done 3/4 biscuit literally dough; gooey dough disintegrating rest dish .

There plenty space we got seated a little corner next the restroom it crowded section we could barely get or . Same our server; so hen't come refill our tiny water cup . I wa so thirsty throughout the whole meal . It took forever get someone's attention get the check.Also; placen't cheap! In the end; it worked to $80 per person the meal plus 1.5 drink average per person . In't mind paying good food this place wa truly disappointing even offensive .

I would also add butter the waffle it made buckwheat offer le the traditional butter waffle taste . It also come side watermelon add splash freshness an otherwise relatively heavy dish . The meatloaf also nicely seasoned juicy - welcome change the standard steak frites .

It slightly sweet a hint salt . I would preferred a bit sweeter good nonetheless . Now onto chicken waffle...I tend order dish many restaurant combo sweet savory perfect . While I really enjoyed taste texture buckwheat waffle; I really could done without cheddar top . For it seemed really random have a piece cheddar melted top; I ended scrapping it . I would definitely order waffle without the cheese the waffle the maple syrup combo really good . The fried chicken nicely fried crispy . I honestlyn't not pick the flavor it brined sweet tea . The negative me that the chicken served a sliced lemon top . Even removing the lemon; the citrusy flavor remained . Personally; I not enjoy the taste lemon food I'm sure is not a deal breaker most!

I want grease; lard (unfortunately come the territory) along all the meat; cheese; sugar I personally bear.Root bone alright; I feel skimped the 'soul food' component their cuisine . The waffle chicken the best thing I out everything present . The mac cheese wa 'meh'; wa loose crumby cheesy flavorful . The key lime pie wa way sweet .

We wait our waitress come pick our card check because took long bf walked counter . The lady there asked he could wait our waitress to come to our table already waiting while . The food also a tad disappointing . I expected the chicken to be crispy it clearly not . The flavor there you squeezed lemon juice dipped it in Tabasco/honey sauce . We also ordered their biscuit shrimp grit . The biscuit my favorite today I wish came with the chicken; I'm sure we could've asked . The shrimp grit looked tasted like scrambled egg grit.,2.0 star rating

I opted shrimp grit; wa really good ultimately shrimp grit . My wife's pork dish wa excellent; covered sort green crumb meat fell apart easily . The outdoor seating rather exposed luckily wa quiet side street . The seating general quite close together . I also found service quite slow; may may be your liking .

We shared a baked mac cheese . This biscuit the best aspect the meal . The mac cheese gooey; flavorful; hot . It garnished breadcrumb . Added the perfect amount crunch variation texture . My third course chicken waffle . The chicken desperately needed seasoning . The waffle dry - came cheddar cheese garnished scallion . Great concept; not executed it fullest potential . The waffle needed a sweet (er) element . If you've chicken waffle; need order them here . They're nothing special . My boyfriend ordered the shrimp grit . The grit accompanied corn (traditional); were flavorful undercooked; a little gritty . It came large shrimp; nice . But; ; the shrimp were under needed seasoning . When I come a``Southern""restaurant; I expect the flavor be developed . The last course - dessert - wa a blueberry cobbler wa served a small cast iron vanilla ice cream . Perfect ending a dinner .

This by far best thing we ate probably one best thing I ate weekend . The biscuit SO warm flaky . If can get one thing; get biscuit . I also the deviled egg I really enjoyed! Unfortunately; the remaining dish subpar . The tomato salad really left something be desired . The cucumber tomato cut large chunky; difficult eat; it lacking real flavor; even the mustard vinaigrette . We also got the waffle benedict the fried chicken n waffle sandwich . The yolk one my poached egg solid; the lemon hollandaise superb! The waffle OK a little chewy the fried chicken melted cheese hardened difficult eat . Both dish came with salad; mine delicious my sister wa inedible . They had put WAY much vinegar the dressing.We also ate mac n cheese banana pudding (I know...absurd amount of food!); of were delicious .

They gave u honey sriracha side mixed extremely well . For main course I went the chicken waffle sandwich also really delicious came with these pickled tomato cut the heaviness right .

Their buckwheat waffle perfect tho; soft airy inside . My bfn't order restaurant week menu he wanted Shrimp & Grits . Good choice! The sauce amazing lot shrimp; sauteed onion; corn . Even tho might a bit overwhelming eat whole dish since grit very buttery . This next dish seriously me ftw: chilled watermelon jalapeno; onion; basil lime vinegarette .

2083,21,I not bread person; I tore Grandma Daisy's Angel Biscuits way . It's served two biscuit; decent sized; one paddle board . They flavorful; soft; buttery inside; perfectly crusted . The next small plate hit table Drunken Deviled Eggs . It indeed small plate egg small; Brook Farm Catskills NY . I read somewhere small egg often taste better commonly purchased larger egg; maybe ha something their decision . Maybe presentation . All I know deliciously pickled made perfect appetizer.I also ordered buckwheat cheddar waffle; served bourbon maple syrup . I've read other review waffle small . They . There four plate; enough me; tasted different waffle I've ever past . I loved every bite couldn't finish last one . I took home; along other item; tasted almost good when I ordered . Nothing beat eating food fresh kitchen . I don't generally like syrup; I couldn't resist bourbon maple syrup . What this place? Some sort sorcery; I'm sure.The fried chicken macaroni n' cheese completed main meal . I thought the chicken pretty good . I would liked the skin be bit crispier; it cooked well; juicy; served hot . The mac n' cheesen't bad; I would've like they seasoned it within the dish rather than seemingly the top . It a big serving a side I thought more a shareable item . Now this point; I freaking stuffed expressing loud itn't possible me eat any more . The server; very attentive throughout dinner; came back the table ask we interested looking the dessert menu . Um; yes please :) Ok ;'s the last review: The key lime pie served in the tiniest glass jar well layered just I needed leaving . I love key lime pie; I'm glad I wan't disappointed . So so tasty; perfectly sweetened . And they have ginger beer a beverage option bump all the way in my book! I would absolutely come back; seat reserved . I would probably stay away visiting a Saturday early Sunday . It's a tiny restaurant; a lot of NY restaurant . Our table wa small; server the kitchen an excellent job pacing the food so that our table wa never overwhelmed plate . Great service; great food; nice restaurant; and the parking wa easy on this particular late Sunday afternoon . I would absolutely come back.,5.0 star rating
2084,21,Service nice . Food . Fried chicken leg cold . Waffles flavor . Eggs perfect heavy sauce without salt peppar; (added salt finish). For table the best biscuit; delicious .

Outside taco; can get thing like nacho; tostada; ceviche; pupusas (!); even french toast brunch . The cocktail menu notable; funky concoction like matcha; coconut tequila; cilantro; mezcal coconut . I went the pupusas's dish I grew I rarely see NYC . As far pupusas go; certainlyn't the one I grew with; wa I expecting to; all all were tasty . I paired with the 'Matcha Coconut' cocktail ended being little umami for my taste . I wanted to little more coconut-y le matcha-y .

My criticism this place most vegan restaurant: Stop labeling vegan ingredient``meat""! First; entire thing just confusing . It would been simpler know right away``carnitas""jackfruit``fish""actually chayote . I knew place vegan decided eat anyway try deceive confuse me by labeling the menu item that manner? In addition; subscribe a vegan diet assumption that're actually chasing meat fish flavor . So why try? No vegan substitute ever taste like pork . In my opinion ;'re better letting the vegetable shine wonderful glory! For example; the jackfruit wa ok I actually felt like their preparation it justice . Have you ever a jackfruit dish India or the Philippines?! You would not care that itn't taste like pork; trust me .

2245,23,Absolutely LOVE décor place . At first glance; look like pretty small restaurant despite lack space Thai Villa made most transport intimate Thai palace.The chandelier center breathtaking booth along side make dining experience much cozier . There's also second floor either side restaurant accommodate 1-2 table an elevated alcove want privacy.For food; menu overwhelming . They standard Thai dish (pad thai; green curry) if've ventured try place; wouldn't going such common dish . Instead; I'd recommend the Kha Nom Boung Youen (crispy egg crepe stuffed mixed seafood). I wouldn't even call crepe crispy flaky you could break off eat it like chip . The seafood it came paired perfectly.I also tried the Hor Mok Talay - very rich creamy curry steamed egg fresh seafood served coconut shell . When I say seafood; In't mean typical frozen shrimp tiny scallop . There juicy; fresh shrimp huge chunk tender salmon all packed this tiny coconut.My complaint the wait time . Theyn't take reservation weekend offer a live waitlist you can join Yelp . However; this isn't accurate all . Even I checked on time; the hostess said it would another 30 minute . If you're going to implement a waitlist; I would try to get accurate a possible so peoplen't to pack like sardine the small waiting area.Regardless; I'd come back to try one their many unique dish . Definitely a nice change your typical Thai restaurant.,4.0 star rating

Overall wa really one dish wa successful tonight . With price tag name; wa disappointing . Maybe I not order right thing (I ordered dish yelper recommended).

Because I drove half hour away even called ahead make sure they would open; I accepted hostile offer conversation manager informed reflected Yelp instead piece paper front store whoever picked phone should've told place would be open . After; I waited 1.5 hour have the saltiest Thai food I have ever (huge fan Thai food; I've tried numerous authentic Thai restaurant Thailand; Singapore; the U.S.). The Tom Yum Goong Yum Woon Sen; the direction incorrect; forced order extra rice order ease consuming them . It shame I brought parent got the impression the salt overload; mention the unpleasant encounter the receptionists.But hey; every place deserves second chance I love Thai food . So I went . I made reservation 5:30pm went in without long wait . The same receptionist while were walking the table; came no surprise friend mentioned enjoy their gut the last time she . But important the food; I ordered the same couple dish . Sadly; there wa a notable difference . Thai food in fact the saltier side relative other cuisine place completely overdoes . It might fit to the like America definitely not authentic . It's a pity the most edible dish wa the fried rice isn't even technically Thai . Given my two visit; I'm not sorry to say this place is beyond hyped I be back if I craving a lot salt top salt . It's more a month since I mentioned that the hour not correctly reflected Yelp .

2298,23,I randomly came Thai Villa lunch one day doctor's appointment near Flat Iron building...I'm glad I! Thai Villa a real jewel a restaurant; a wonderful combination friendly fast service; beautiful setting; delicious food . I would definitely come back! I came early enough get weekday lunch special ended ordering soup; chive pancake; roast duck pad thai; along a pot flowering jasmine tea . The soup a savory mushroom broth very warming a cool day; chive pancake one coolest; gelatinous dish I've ever tried . Both come highly recommended! Meanwhile; flowering jasmine tea a lovely treat blossomed pot (although got rather bitter it kept steeping pot). Finally; the roast duck pad thai wa delicious (albeit rather standard) big enough last lunch dinner.Overall; I paid $29 (including tax tip) for my lunch--somewhat steep expected given the restaurant's location . I'd still recommend the place--it's a great experience worth the splurge!,4.0 star rating

I thought I a strong stomach I pretty much eat anything without getting sick . Spicy; sour; sweet; savory; bitter...you name . I go downstairs absolutely bomb the toilet stomach could take . Sorry the person use lol . Anyways; I'm pretty sure stomach hurting because I believe the steakn't cooked properly even though tasted it . My stomach fine after I ate the appetizer; after eating the steak; I felt ill . I thought I wa done; I went back upstairs meet with my friend . Then my stomach started hurting; I go back downstairs . I had go TWICE a matter 10 minute . To the staff management: please make sure the meat cooked the appropriate temperature wellness . That; please make sure everything clean serving please not cross-contaminate . I know this restaurant get extremely busy the kitchen trying to get dish; customer pay money to eat food I not expect even slightly to get sick eating .

Most Thai place usually like decorate the restaurant dark red gold decor; restaurant ornately the top - fancy would an understatement . Gold ornament garnished everywhere ceiling 20 foot high enhanced the beauty the restaurant even . After much pondering; boyfriend I ended ordering Thai Tea; chicken pad see ew; beef pad thai . The Thai Tea beautifully presented in a seemingly small cute milk bottle . However; started drinking; realized held than enough Thai Tea . Although we ordered drink ourselves; we probably could been safe splitting one Thai Tea . It very sweet creamy; the Thai Tea still kept bold characteristic . Overall a strong sweet Thai Tea - perfect . The chicken pad see ew savory! I'm sure they used soy sauce hoisin sauce; definitely flavorful enough taste bland; not much the thick noodle would turn sodden the sauce . The chicken very soft; opposed dry chewy . Theren't many vegetable; is great; some place tend make entree 50% vegetable . The pad thai surprisingly sweet! Sometimes In't order for because it may spicy; it actually pretty sweet! It a delectably pleasant surprise . The beef wa also not too chewy; is something boyfriend I appreciated . Overall Thai Villa is beautiful amazing! I'm so glad Yelp kept asking me to come and review this place . Thai Villa some of the best Thai food around NY!,5.0 star rating

2346,23,Beautiful decor good food- great place date night small gathering friend . I think biggest table have 7 people . Definitely make reservation though; wait time about 45 min an hour (even party 2!).Our waiter (Jay?) extremely helpful . He explained expansive menu u since first time (left side consists usual Thai food could find other Thai restaurant; middle menu consists food made special ingredient; right contains chef's specialty). Based waiter's recommendation; ordered one popular appetizer share (Ray Rai Nah Phu). It consisted 4 pieces- shrimp rice noodle curry paste crab meat wrapped betel leaf . At first ;n't realize we supposed wrap up leaf (like dumpling); just ate topping . The leaf itselfn't good (seriously ;n't eat leaf itself!). Once eat everything together (leaf wrapped around noodle paste); is really good balance flavor . Good start meal.For entree; I chose kha nom boung youen (crispy egg crepe stuffed mixed seafood). I really enjoyed dish . The egg crepe a nice crunch flavored really well . There a generous portion seafood inside the cucumber dip a nice touch.My friend the red curry a steak dish . Can't give much info these dish In't try; did say they enjoyed their entrees.For drink; I chose the lychee iced tea . It's basically a thai iced tea (without the condensed milk) 2 piece lychee . While refreshing; it tasted much like the thai tea mix can buy the supermarket . I wa hoping for more of a lychee flavor the drink...My friend got the lemonade thai tea.. It tasted like a thai iced tea minus condensed milk; you could definitely taste the lemonade mixed in.Service wa good . Our water constantly refilled they checked with u see we enjoying the food every and then.Definitely a place worth checking if you're the area . Will definitely make another visit soon!,4.0 star rating

2348,23,Been wanting come longest time . Came once time wait table around 2 hour more already starving . Finally came back day ago for late lunch . They fully booked theyn't accept rsvp; walk-in . So got 3; wait long all; waited longer since friendn't arrived yet they sit complete party.Everything this place aesthetically pleasing; say least . From decor; presentation food; even staff :) The restaurantn't big they have 2 separate small mezzanine . Staffs friendly knowledgeable; explained menu well offered take picture group several time haha . There some mix-up one server deliver wrong food table several time big deal.Food came super quickly; though . We surprised they came still busy taking picture interior lol . The four u ordered Curry Puffs; Royal Pad Thai (beautiful In't want ruin presentation eating; taste good); Tom Kha Gai soup (good); Papaya Salad (fresh flavor); Crispy Duck (favorite our table); Seafood Mix Coconut Shell (the flavor this is very rich); our vegetarian friend got the Vegetable Panang Curry (really loved); Tom Yum Fried Rice (quite good); the vegetarian crepe dumpling (good; chewy soft). Everything delicious; bursting flavor . Thai Villa certainly live our expectation all aspect . I seriously can't wait to go back.One thing I surprised . We seated 3:40pm not made aware they actually close the afternoon 4-5 . There were people sitting eating table we thought wa business usual; when we were exiting; I realized they the staff working . During our dining (3:40-4:45pm); we were not rushed at all not informed the break . Feeling bad interrupting break time . Also wa worth mentioning that when we were approaching the restaurant; wa a homeless guy wa loitering nearby screaming racist slur at us.. then the other direction; a staff Thai Villa gave a box food the restaurant . What a really nice gesture.,5.0 star rating

2352,23,Based review read fellow yelpers; had great expectation Thai Villa . Alas; weren't met my first recent visit . The restaurant beautiful - lovely; golden lighting décor offset carved wooden paneling wall make dining space quite stunning look . The service also amiable attentive . hoping food would steal show; turned okay . The menu offered great deal variety; for uninitiated; organized 3 main section'll paraphrase : 1. Thai food're used; 2. Thai food're used; 3 . Thai cuisine Chef elevated . Sounded promising! And; traveled extensively Thailand experienced many well-seasoned culinary delight; looking forward all sort flavor just never showed up.Because dining sharing great friend; mixed our selection encompass bit each the 3 menu sections.The rundown:1 . The calamari appetizer is wonderful . Nicely seasoned; crispy; a great peanut dipping sauce . This our favorite.2 . The Ray rai nah phu is minced shrimp rice noodle with curry paste a betel leaf pleasantly creatively presented; the depth flavor lacking . There no taste curry no flavor enhance the shrimp . Disappointing.3 . The sea bass coconut milk sounded like it wa gonna so good - a small bed mushroom; the server poured steaming coconut milk top . But too wa lacking flavor richness . The fish wa cooked perfectly; there wan't enough seasoning the coconut milk elevate the dish . It actually began taste better it got colder; who want eat cold fish cold broth? 4 . The crab fried rice wa presented well; the crab meat just lacked freshness . couldn't finish it.Overall :'ll return point Thai Villa have of the calamari try some of the other offering the menu . But'm exactly dying to return.,3.0 star rating

Super large portion; despite priciness; getting money's worth . It's $17 bowl; a rather large bowl . The noodle are perfectly cooked; bouncy chewy . The broth differs depending what udon order; for the two I tried (Gyunan Niku); were fantastic . Rich; flavorful; high-quality udon . Highly recommended all!,5.0 star rating
2356,24,Love everything Raku! From lovely exterior small intimate space . This place hidden gem can easily missed . There's sign door lookout their simplistic curtain . My boyfriend I come weekday there's usually wait we always seated immediately.Can't go wrong anything menu; everything delicious! I a huge fan their udon love the bouncy chewy texture the noodle . I always go their Niku Udon ($ 17 . CASH ONLY) come beef short-ribs & honeycomb tripe . $17 may seem like a lot money a bowl udon the portion size leaf feeling full I appreciate the amount beef short-ribs honeycomb tripe give . The tripe easy bite the beef flavorful . The broth it come light really hit the spot . The staff welcoming super attentive contributes the overall pleasant dining experience.Raku is one my favorite restaurant one I be coming back time and time!,5.0 star rating
2357,24,TO; DR: abysmal experience vegetarian - avoid all cost trying eat vegetarian . SO I came Friday night they're Yelp waitlist friend loved experience . Wen't wait Bc waitlist; once arrived; realized there basically 100% vegetarian warm udons (they're known!). Every udon fish broth; my SO I got udon hot water dipping sauce; poached egg shiitake mushroom (warned ;'re charged $2 a single shiitake mushroom cap). We fried tofu start veggie dumpling; fine - nothing write home . Fried tofu crispy tofu in soy sauce onion; veggie dumpling some nondescript veggie filling a watered soy sauce / vinegar dip . Pass . Raku all the udon; excited try dipping sauce udon.WRONG . The hot water udon literally a $10 dish boiled udon noodle soy sauce the dipping sauce; plus a tiny quail egg some green onion . It utterly tasteless; the one shiitake cap paid $2 the poached egg cost $2 added nothing our dish . We were so disappointed spent $15 something could have made le $3 home . There nothing extraordinary the dish the overall flavor profile Raku tried pull together.With tax and tip; we spent $17.50 apiece one of the worst vegetarian experience I've in the city . Only come a a vegetarian you're ok fish broth.,1.0 star rating
2358,24,Raku You not experienced amazing udon've experienced Raku!! It's almost hidden side street; no sign their door . It super small restaurant almost always wait wait worth . Two u came a Saturday 9pm wait 30 minute . Good thing this place can join waitlist Yelp on your way there . Not much a waiting area wait amongst waiter table . So many udon option . The niku udon seems popular delicious I personally not a fan tripe . We went the chikara udon gyunan udon the chicken tatsuta-age . Food come about 10 minute . Chicken tatsuta-age: There a 6 10 piece chicken option . The chicken come perfectly fried - light layer crispiness that doen't dry the chicken.Udon: Lots meat I appreciate since seems like many place give you a piece meat . The mochi chewy sticky . But the noodle - SO GOOD . They tasted fresh; homemade . Not soggy just the right amount chewiness you bite in . Attentive service they give you a frozen grape the end your meal . Good portion - were stuffed afterwards . I would come back this udon anytime . Simple beautifully executed.,5.0 star rating
2359,24,When come noodle broth I ever hear ramen; ramen; ramen! Udon probably feel like Jan towards sister Marsha Brady Bunch - tired her popular sibling getting attention . Finding Raku; spot specializes udon made excited try somewhat neglected dish NY . Raku small; minimalist spot diner slurp bowl noodle negative space black canvas white canvas . When enter weather outside come you door open directly dining room (Not comfortable Arctic air decides descend upon NYC). A curtain; an enclosure outside front door would work wonder; yeah I know; minimal aesthetic - look function! I liked served Sapporo Reserve; is little extra typical Sapporo . The Chicken Tatsuta-age decent; nicely crisp; I found chicken somewhat chewy tender flavorful I hoped since marinated . The Ankimo - Monkfish liver scallion fantastic! A rich; creamy seafood pate served pre-sliced quarter making easy share . Somewhat small portion; pack flavor punch.For Udon main I ordered the popular Niku Udon short rib tripe . The tripe absolutely the most tender I ever tried - not a hint chewiness . I wish the bowl . The short rib piece generous fall apart tender . The broth scallion delicately flavored along the component . The udon noodle thick; al-dente; satisfying . The broth tasted like a subtle tonkatsu; say it rich; surprisingly light well . I also tried of the Kamonan udon contained duck breast . I always find poultry went served ramen spot to be chewy; the applies with the udon . The broth wa more towards a shoyu flavor profile.This spot is cash which I always find a bit sketch in this day age . Service wa attentive; expectedly since they had 3 server (!) the small space . I wa more 3.5 star; that cold breeze hitting back all night soured a bit I rounded.,3.0 star rating
2360,24,This place feel authentic Japanese!!! The service; interior; food! Loved came weekend; were many family w toddler haha like enjoying nice meal . And layout I guess make convenient they got booth For food: good very satisfying . I got eel egg bowl it very satisfying!! The curry beef ramen also tasty . I really like ramen; good texture we also tried few apps; fav wa the duck,4.0 star rating
2361,24,Wow; I pretty much expectation going; a huge udon lover; I think best udon I've ever . I know Niku udon very popular; I went ahead got nameko; soup udon dish light broth seaweed mushroom . It perfect lighter broth lunchtime; yet still super satisfying . The presumably hand made udon made perfection; just enough bounciness chewiness . I not rave the soup udon enough! This location is tiny; every time the door open the winter; gust freezing air come the restaurant . I'll definitely going back the larger West Village location soon! Like NY restaurant; Raku seat complete party.,5.0 star rating
2362,24,Raku straightforward udon+ restaurant . I came friend dinner . Prices a bit the high side udon; line the rest New York ;'s cash; there's atm in door . The restaurant cozy; maybe 20 seat . Expect a wait . Service attentive . Niku udon- beef broth; chewy long udon noodle; piece tripe beef; surprisingly pleasant light broth with a good amount flavorShrimp tempura - 2 shrimp were lightly battered,4.0 star rating
2363,24,Best ramen I've ever life . Although gem tucked away a random dark alley Soho District; highly rated google review decided give a try . The broth; noodle; portion all expectation--I believe were known honeycomb tripe's we ordered . The sweet waitress embodied the polite Japanese culture greeting u a warm smile hand help every time passed . The seating area wa a little claustrophobic of the restaurant small capacity; I guess a way that wa another way we experienced Japanese culture in the state.,5.0 star rating
2364,24,Let start saying I not like udon . I'd choose ramen udon day; unless udon came! When trying find restaurant; almost missed . Theren't huge sign display name . It's simply wooden door small sign door restaurant's name covered by curtain; keep eye open . When open door; are imersed room give Japanese vibe . It very clean; simple; small . NIKU UDON ($ 17): The texture udon so soft; thick; chewy..almost a texture a mochi . It the best udon I ever life I forever on a search find a similar spot LA . This bowl huge a ton braised beef . The beef good; the honeycomb tripe stood . Again; I not like tripe; this tripe so soft easy bite . The downside this bowl the soup . I thought salty In't want slurp it.FRIED CHICKEN ($ 7/11): You choose 6 10 piece chicken . This the tender chicken ever! In't know what it is; the batter light crispy the perfect texture taste the karage . There also a sauce could dip the chicken in that had masago (I think) inside it . That different everything a whole so good.Overall; it wa a bit expensive udon; I would still come back to NY just to eat here . Trust; the udon wa that good . TIP: CASH ONLY,5.0 star rating
2365,24,I can't East Village anymore . Gems like drain wallet turn into fatty . My buddy I walked this place 5 time trying find . It's unassuming entrancen't marked . Walking; feel instantly teleported Japan . Authentic vibe permeate every aspect this restaurant - seating; decoration; lighting; staff.We ordered shrimp tempura udon . The noodle chewy; filling; cooked perfection . Some best I've ever . The broth above average . Although shrimp tasty; the other meat likely complement the soup better . Service is fast attentive . Prices reasonable given the quality ($ 14-18 depending which dish). Cash; they an ATM site.Oishi!!!!,5.0 star rating
2366,24,This place amazing!!!!!! We arrived little 5:40PM it empty.The server super friendly the place cute . Probably around 20 seating it decently priced . It hard find first thank goodness Google map . The Ja Ja cold udon so flavorful the Tan Tan Udon on point . The soup cleaner compared the usual Tan Tan soup base get a Ramen spot is creamier . I come back.,5.0 star rating
2367,24,Came friend dinner excited try udon . I've second location MacDougal not original spot . Definitely original spot smaller; reservation; cash . The new spot definitely prettier better dining experience . Everyone bit crammed be seated facing wall . Otherwise; food fantastic . In't need to continue raving around quality udon; it broth really shine . Its flavor the broth really make Raku a fan favorite . I the crab egg soup my friend had the shrimp tempura udon (with a much lighter broth). Both broth fantastic . Good amount salt flavor . Cash . I know a bit cram; the food solid; the service good; and the ambiance great . 5/5 would return and try their other udon broth . This place wa so good that my friend came twice 3 day!!,5.0 star rating
2368,24,This place good!! I love exterior aesthetic ;'s super clean visually . Before get; make sure have entire party otherwise you won't seated . They take CASH ONLY way; is important note . My 3 friend I got Niku udon; the beef short-rib the honeycomb tripe oh word; so fire . The broth super flavorful the beef extremely tender; very easy chew eat! The service wa also great; the waitress would always refill water cup without asked . Would definitely recommend!,5.0 star rating
2369,24,I enjoyed one best udon bowl I've at Raku; definitely want come back try . The noodle alone worth trip--nice chewy; not overly dense like standard store-bought udon . I short rib tripe; the short rib very tender; the dish overall great.For appetizer; tried the fried chicken thick-cut bacon; were good; the highlight definitely the noodle.,4.0 star rating
2370,24,The best udon place town!!!!!!!! I love place much! The store sign hard find sure! I almost missed when I tried walk using google map! The inside very tiny! We came around 20 min's closed a weekday it pretty empty! The soup sooooo good! I never anything good!!! I kept slurping tried drink soup! Just simply excellent!!!! They take cash and is ATM inside the store! If are ever town; visit this place!!! You won't regret it!!!: ),5.0 star rating
2371,24,Raku certainly perfect spot udon . If come cold winter night; won't regretting . Just make sure focus on their udon dish; their specialty . We got curry udon washugyu beef ($ 17); one their reputable udon bowl . The curry thick first tasted watery towards end bowl; still taste turmeric cumin each spoonful . The noodle what made dish shine: deliciously chewy kept going that bowl . Since portion size pretty generous udon; you keep chewing noodle slurping soup warms body . The beef pretty standard affair . You could alternatively get your curry udon chicken that dish better served beef; trust . The second dish got unatama ($ 16); experience a poor execution a dish that could had potential . First all; much egg not enough eel dish . The eel; generally is served large whole piece other Japanese spot; chopped smaller slice blend the egg; rather got lost among the egg . The bottom the rice bowl wa too watery - the sauce could been more dry my opinion.Before meal; also got the 3 pressed mackerel sushi (sabazushi) appetizer ($ 5); tasted mediocre in the world pressed sushi; good an option those'd like try it for the first time!,4.0 star rating
2372,24,Great ambiance fast service . Marinated fried chicken app amazing udon elevated; amazing noodle broth . Still think it time time . Definitely worth the wait!,5.0 star rating
2373,24,Came friend lunch! We arrived 12pm dot open got seated right away . This place like foil Tsurutontan; popular udon restaurant city . While Tsurutontan upscale flashy; Raku basically borderline hole wall . The decor very simplistic table very close each other . I would say seat max 20 people time . In't think even air conditioning . We came an unseasonably warm day November I sweating time left I only imagine's like dining summer . Our waitress kind adept . Customers started pouring shortly we started eating she skillfully serviced entire restaurant.We ordered: Chicken tatsuta age- Not best Japanese fried chicken I've . While meat tender; the coating/batter left much be desired . Comes a delicious spicy mayo sauce though.Niku udon- Their signature udon dish course we try . I'm usually a big fan braised meat the beef short rib tender flavorful! Same the honeycomb tripe . If prepared incorrectly (aka overcooked) it tends be overly chewy; the texture perfect . The udon noodle were amazing . The texture perfectly bouncy you can tell they make the noodle hand . The broth good first I got bored of it the end.Kamonan udon- Really enjoyed the duck breast meat in this one . Not fatty flavor wa on point . I would say the udon here par with those Tsurutontan . If I had to choose; I would say Tsurutontan win by a hair; that's mainly I prefer more spacious lively restaurant . However; you're looking something simpler traditional; Raku is the way to go.,4.0 star rating

2375,24,Came on late Saturday night friend . We ordered Niku; Tantan noodle fried chicken . I the Niku seems be popular I must say I really enjoyed . The beef the beef tripe really soft tendered!! The broth flavorful the udon soft chewy . My friend the tantan noodle looked really tasty I'm into spicy food In't really get good taste . As far the fried chicken it wa juicy surprisingly . If the portion the noodle give not enough can order noodle . So's always a plus my book whon't like noodle!,4.0 star rating
2376,24,Best udon I had state! * * * EXPERIENCE * * *It's easy miss restaurant location there's big sign; when arrive outside look Japanese; something would expect see wandering around Kyoto . I'm also surprised the number udon option offer both cold hot; hard choose! The restaurant pretty small; I went rather late ~2pm a Thursday there line . * * * FOOD * * *Niku Udon: AThe udon noodle so soft yet chewy; I also noticed the two end each udon noodle's flat rather round; I guess mean's hand made house? The soup wa delicious - strong beef taste; too salty at all surprisingly lot flavor . This udon bowl came short rib ;'s also another highlight - wa extremely tender braised perfectly . I almost wanted ask just another piece In't care much would charge it.Kiriboshi Daikon: AA refreshing cold appetizer; nicely seasoned the daikon all chopped mixing bean curd; with some soy sauce flavor it . Very nice especially a hot summer day.There's no doubt I go back place next time I'm town . Just typing review I miss this place already ...,5.0 star rating
2377,24,I feel like I'm always little disappointed place hyped; one . I'm not huge Udon connoisseur anything; this definitely best I've had.First all; need game plan get here . I tried walking time; never decided wa worth 1hr+ wait time (ala; would been). My suggestion park a nearby dive bar hop Yelp wait list . Make suren't close or anything you get quick you're called! I think only hold table a couple mins.Anyways; you're going to amazing traditional udon you get there . The noodle to die; a chewy texture I've never experienced done perfectly . The broth one few broth I have actually wanted to drink end my meal; lol . Plus the meat is awesomely tender . I'd give the rib + tripe option a try you are a meat eater.,5.0 star rating
2378,24,This place lived hype . Me a group friend attempted come west village location a Tuesday night turned away we found west village location took reservation wen't walk in's day I knew I come back try place . A week later I decided go try their udon their east village location everyone keep raving place . As I approached restaurant; I missed twice walked because didn't a restaurant sign anywhere easily recognizable a restaurant . I recommended place their famous udon small restaurant hand best udon place I've tried thus far . Their udonn't compare any udon I've tried . I ordered curry udon beef chicken Tatsu.Dishes: Curry udon w/ beef 9/10The udon silly fresh can really taste uniqueness the noodle the so good the mix scallion onion . My complaint would the beef wa a little tough to chew overall I would definitely come back dish.Chicken Tatsu 5/10Only reason I ordered this dish wa because the recommendation popularity the dish . However I'm sure it wa the one I ordered the dish naturally taste like . The chicken a strong stench wa a turn . It's a smell the moment bite the meat; is just an dead animal taste to it . With that said; I could enjoy this dish to it fullest potential and would order this again.,4.0 star rating

Taste really high quality the way look (kinda like fettuccine) different other competitor . It a bit pricey . Would definitely come back.,4.0 star rating
2381,24,I love tiny noodle restaurant; although waiting time always long due limited space . I would suggest people put name first then take walk .

2383,24,Raku small cozy restaurant specializes udon small Japanese small eats . The service very friendly; I love modern decor restaurant; however; prepare wait you come peak hour since the restaurant tiny.The dumpling pretty good; I wish fried just bit to make crispy since tasted bit like cross steamed pan-fried dumpling liquid dripping out.The spicy pork ramen peanut-based brothn't spicy; personally bit creamy; In't feel like worked Udon all whatsoever . The beef wagyu udon your typical Udon flavor; it just a tad bit salty.Overall; a terrible Udon place; I wouldn't call it my favorite one either; however; I'm the neighborhood; I'd consider dropping.,4.0 star rating
2384,24,First time I stopped Saturday night; I rebuffed an hour wait . This time I came around on Thursday afternoon still seating available.Interesting interior/exterior; reminiscent small cottage (theme?). To start; ordered small Chicken Tatsuta-age ($ 7) an IPA ($ 12). Chicken six perfectly fried nugget an even balance breading meat . To dip chicken there spicy mayo's bad (could used kick). Since a warm day; opted Hiyashi Cold Udon ($ 9). A bowl of plain cooked udon noodle swimming ice water; served alongside dipping sauce; scallion; wasabi . Immediately threw wasabi the sauce give it some spice . Noodles cooked amazingly well; wa actually refreshing eat dipping the soy sauce . Once the meal finished; the check is presented two frozen grape (a nice dessertn't punish stomach).Service here is superb; wa surprisingly and after 30 minute . Cash suck; it doe keep price . Would come back a hot udon dish the winter.,4.0 star rating
2385,24,UPDATE: My husband I been Raku probably 50 time past year . However; came today felt quality the Niku udon not par . The soup not rich; beef not tender like usual the noodle undercooked . We both underwhelmed really disappointed today's order our frequent previous experience so good! Maybe we just came a bad day . Really wish guy would bring back the udon to it original flavor quality.My boyfriend I fell love this place . Been coming almost every week ever since . Niku udon the best my opinion; would totally recommend!,2.0 star rating

The French toast enjoyed they seemed like the egg ok although one my friend said the bohemian egg bit oily the bottom . One my friend ordered cafe au lait I think the waiter misheard brought a drip coffee? Overall a pleasant brunch . The wait staff friendly although I have a little trouble waving . The part left brunch a sour note wa after paid walked the block already; one the waiter chased u; out of breath yell u . He asked found anything unsatisfactory confusedly answered .

The cheese I selected my 2 pc charcuterie: tomme the meat I picked speck . The tomme cow's milk cheese I believe had nice woodsy finish . Reminded cross swiss like nutty flavor combined . The speck appeared dry wa short flavor wa actually fine . I guess I've seen it more moist this threw off . Speck a cured ham a bit finer . I love cured meat . They Serrano the menu couldn't swing a third choice . Was getting really full . For dessert shared the apple pie two . Make mistake; not a portion two definitely a shareable dessert it say . Essentially pie a la mode sharing but the crust what make this one different memorable . It's a must try .

2573,27,This an incredibly long overdue review . Juliana's amazing pizza-hands; best Brooklyn.We got large pizza-half white; half margarita . The sauce slightly sweet little kick-it's simple overdone-just a perfect pizza sauce be . The cheese fresh; creamy stringy-just cheese be a pizza . The crust thin without flimsy ;'s pliable enough fold without breaking half-just a pizza crust be . Everything Juliana's pizza exactly pizza be; it's literally perfect pizza IMO.With of said; perfect pizza place it downside aka really long line . A quick tip-your best bet going the week right they open (11am I believe). When fiancé went; happened randomly take of work a Monday we walked the Brooklyn bridge manhattan got right they opened were seated immediately (along some folk had waiting them open). However; about 15 minute of them opening; large crowd started flooding; this a cloudy Monday . So; ; go they open a weekday . If not; go early and wait them open on a weekend avoid crazy long line . I promise you; the line worth it though.,5.0 star rating
2574,27,Juliana Pizza unique taste . The pizza sauce herby; salty not too sweet . The crust though it thin very chewy . They not a regular cheese pie; Margherita pie would regular cheese pie you add topping your liking . The cesar salad wa more the vinegar side still very good refreshing .

We ordered bottled drink (diet coke) then pizza came not long . The pizza my kind pizza . First; I love good thin crust classic NYC pizza . So fit mold me . The sauce slightly sweet we got a nice cheese stringy 'tude I hope pizza! Our server nice; attentive kept drink refilled! I honestlyn't know the difference between here and Grimaldi's .

Every aspect really flavorful.The atmosphere high class server not uppity . They even invited to take close picture of the oven of the cook making pizza dough . They also cannoli pasta dish you really order the pizza you're . The pizza pricey IMO probably normal NYC (around $30 small pie; small actually generous size). I hear's often a line this place . In't believe sell slice; this a dine establishment . Either way it's worth time . Put Juliana's on your pizza list!,5.0 star rating

2597,27,Being NY; cousin & I knew had find amazing NY style pizza place else wouldn't doing trip right . After spending time Brooklyn; walked few minute reopened afternoon (4pm) already line waiting outside freezing temp . There 7 8 party ahead u; figured'd wait hoping would die quickly . Someone got line behind u actually went inside asked long wait would . They told 20-30 minute . Definitelyn't even close . For u; ended hour wondering much longer would people behind u line got much longer . Once FINALLY got inside; were seated two-top table wall next wall light nice cozy . Our server ;n't energetic outgoing; took care u made sure had everything needed our dining experience . Pizza price here are expensive; no doubt knew New York place being ranked high pizza city ;'d paying it . We ordered arugula; Italian ham pizza (they were able actually split pizza half u since cousin vegetarian wa nice chef). Pizza wa very good; nothing really rave about . Maybe didn't get the best pizza there? Hmmm; the sauce cheese tasted very good quality; the pizza crust wa on point . Maybe we needed topping? In't think the pizza justified an hour wait though . If we had waited the 20-30 minute suggested the staff; I think we would been little bit receptive the pizza . I feel I would come back try this place; for different pizza choice . We'd also hope get a different server since the server the room just seemed happier more outgoing . Those type change make a huge difference the perception the customer far dining experience . Plenty option for pizza in NYC.... need try other one!,3.0 star rating

I ordered No . 1.: mozzarella; scamorza affumicata; pancetta (italian bacon); scallion oregon-grown white truffle olive oil .There no tomato the pizza . The white truffle and olive oil give smooth buttery aftertaste make so much savory . The crust too thin thick just right . One the best slice I've . Even though's 28 dollar a small; is big a medium smaller large . Definitely feed two people.I also love they wrap the leftover pizza slice . Each two slice get own tinfoil wrap .

Especially since wanted order appetizer get started...anyway...Food decent . Small over priced . Hummus good great . Pita bread cold; small; kinda dry . Burger tasty; should come fry with the $16 price tag . I thought the flatbread looked good based other yelp photo disappointed . I would liked order something else no one checked our table the time ordered; we to go ask our check . I'm even certain out server; I think wa the bartender?

MISTAKE . We shared mussel got 3 mezzes - spicy feta dip (actually good - thing); mussel frites (bread stale butter soaked mussel super fresh); zucchini pancake (limp) worst offender; truffle mac cheese . As SO said; we could made better stuff of a box . It wa very oily the noodle dry . Even the complimentary bread wa oily.I feel really heavy unhealthy the meal to top all; the fry the only thing were marginally tasty .

2700,28,Balzem going get 2 star salvaged second half dinner . Three u reserved table 6pm I there 10 minute early . They kindly seated me middle long table . While I waiting; server kept bumping my chair there practically space me chair behind me.. Then 2 minute I sat; they decided sit party 3 just walked in separate table towards back room . When my friend here; requested to table back (rejected) then the high table (also rejected). I understand restuarants have their seating system the seat super uncomfortable since everyone walk around u . After ordered food; the table at the front the restuarant freed tried luck one last time; they said ok . It like uphill battle In't getting good vibe the host . The Good: The server great . One a bit timid nice the gregarious helpful . The food really good . My favorite the octopus . I enjoyed the mushroom truffle oil flatbread; melon salad; Branzini fillet pan seared . In't enjoy the grilled asparagus (expecting to bigger); zucchini pancake (some reason wa spicy); branzini ceviche (wan't sour); the moules frites (spicy). As can see; 2 thing spicy me I biased; the two wan't terrible . We kind ordered too much food we finish of . I would recommend it for drink and food remember small group!,4.0 star rating

2702,28,"This place 5 star END . Basically mom's birthday; I bought whole cheesecake (shoutout Eileen's Special Cheesecake!) asked server glass he could please hold fridge wanted eat at end . Fast forward: another waiter informs I pay own cake served me; $3/person (total $12). This literally never happened life; In't informed beforehand either . I feel like one told me; In't charged . But sucked paid becausen't sure else could go.FOOD: My party 4 ordered blueberry pancake $12; steak egg $16; Mediterranean breakfast $14; grilled brochett $18; truffle mac cheese $14 . The free small bread piece olive oil delightful! I liked little sesame seed . Everyone enjoyed order; I note wa my first time trying truffle . Looks like bread crumb like unique flavor I can't quite describe . Overall amazing dish; albeit quite oily . The pancake thick golden both side . Steak sunny side up egg = fantastic combo . Something meat yolk together; plus small side salad! My dad kept trying get u eat lamb in his brochett; I'm typically fan lamb wa alright--no problem it . The Mediterranean breakfast seemed overly healthy me; my mom enjoyed it.SERVICE: Place got really busy 12:30 pm; understandably tall water bottle wouldn't refilled promptly waiter would hard flag . However; forgot give pancake syrup . When it wa time cake (I paid $12 eat); nicely cleared table . However; literally only brought cake . So I ask plate fork . And ask knife to cut the cake . Not sure I'm expecting much I feel like I to pay $12 extra at least I'll get the right utensil such?

For happy hour; Balzem offer $6 pours the house red white - I believe time I went there tempranillo offered I can't remember the white; both excellent . However; I wish they switched their happy hour wine ('s possible they periodically; I went two time week apart they the both time). Also the happy hour menu a tapas-style dip . My friend I split the spicy feta; $8 the normal menu $5 the happy hour menu; came cucumber pita bread . They also brought some crostinis olive oil olive u nibble . I thought the dip wa delicious the perfect complement the white wine drinking . Service wa fine; nothing exceptional . The bartender great asking u we wanted second glass we were finishing first .

That said; did rush u (fact; service kitchen were slow bring food; communicate; etc We sat at a mildly cramped table . Some u; included frozen rose sangria drink - tasty boozy . To share; manti (good wished were bigger came faster/more flavorful); hummus (weak; no Tahini; nothing special; like store bought hummus even thoughn't loose; nowhere flavorful a thick Greek style hummus); spicy feta (also meh); two order zucchini pancake (tasty - good flaovr crisp). The brunch menu quite extensive you really get all you want - egg; sweet;``lunch""sandwich . I can't recall everyone ordered - sanwiches egg; burger; salads.. I'm sure you will find something your fancy . In general . I strike breakfast food revert lunch; I ordered chicken grilled brochette . It wa really a value - potato au gratin (weird good); herb oil; yogurt trip . Came two large grilled dark meat skewer a grilled bread atop . Standard taste I guess filling satisfying . $18.My husband got the Spinach & egg skillet said could been better . Some others had that - I can't remember anything the food ordered people; sadly.Overall; wa pretty positive nothing special so eh-worthy .

2762,29,"The Ippudo juggernaut continues moving onward upward; recently celebrating 10 year first NYC location; closing 10; 000 mostly positive Yelp review . It took a get around trying Ippudo hearing many friend sing their praise me some best Ramen can get NYC . So on first cool day fall finding a 20 minute wait a table I decided give shot.I surprised how spacious table 2 sat - generously wide In't feel like I sitting neighboring diner . I liked decor energy this fast moving spot . Here's: Pork Buns - popular we see the hype about they certainly lived . Entirely well made pork just melt mouth; crisp fresh lettuce; excellent sauce mayo really hit the spot.Pork Belly Skewers - I completely disappointed this . Grayish piece chewy meat just tasted oily slightly burnt . It had me questioning this actually pork belly.Akamaru Modern -; popular consensus; seems like the ramen get it's``bold translation the original pork broth""description . A fantastic depth flavor . Nitamago; seasoned soft boiled egg; an absolute must get topping; me; Bakudan; spicy paste I prefer add selected bite to prevent taste bud getting fatigued . Simply lovely soul warming bowl.The Sapporo draft the perfect temperature; nice cold; may seem counter intuitive when having broth; it work so well . I also loved the Matcha Green Tea gelato; velvety smooth a dusting matcha powder gave perfect green tea flavor.When are finished slurping your ramen move out the packed bar eagerly waiting diner are anxiously waiting to grab your spot .

They serving sake 1985 Ramen Zero.I think large spacious large amount seating inside could fit say approximate eye view estimate 50-60 people surely help line moving . It nudged an even space though took 1 hour 45 minute slight chill get shortage people willing wait . After I completed 30 minute dining there another long line around corner.It well staffed; around dozen greeter; server; cook; yelling loud cheer.That ramen came quick looked well plated . The broth mildly light flavor if cooked chicken pork . The ramen softer compared other ramen place; without wimpy soggy . The pork belly slice same; light flavor; smokiness; braised; char note it; a neutral-light flavor . An egg 75% way boiled without the shell . Let's say the Ramen Zero 1985 wa very good; tasty a subtle way served not too hot above warmth temperature . And; yes; consider among the top the ramen broth I had . With a smooth sake ice water refilled; there's no complaints.The atmosphere spacious; communal; dark fully visible; nothing the table garnish only a donation a cause bin the table . You see the handful cook the assembly line making the ramen . Think wood rope tied around pole a Japanese style other bit Japanese ambience.,4.0 star rating

I like's a bar front house; kicking drink waiting definitely option (post-dinner drink). Atmosphere dim constant noise - seemed a good pick a date night; I would personally want something quieter . Speaking date ;'ll easiest time getting seated you're a group two; there's ample bar seating small two-person table; whereas group table a little rare . Groups coming after u seated much quickly; even though only three . We skipped appetizer favor doing dessert later our night; everything sounded super good (have visit). Ramen order came quickly; within 15 minute being seated . I the shiromaru hakata classic - perfect milky broth perfectly seasoned topping (special shoutouts the menma the kikurage mushroom). Friends the karaka men (a little spicy me a full bowl; very very flavorful; great for a cooler night) the akamaru modern (great take; slightly flavored the classic great the nitamago). Overall; worth the visit for a solid bowl; provided the waitn't long (wait cap would be an hour). But definitely would visit; maybe split the karaka men (plus appetizer) next time!",4.0 star rating

The restaurantn't take reservation; rolling dice chance wait eternity seated (I hear pretty common specific spot). However; got lucky! We came around 6:10 PM only wait 3 minute table available . I can't say same all others saw waiting left . The lobby PACKED people waiting open table . Good thing got earlier side.The restaurant surprisingly large; given fact's lobby so small . When entered main dining area were collectively greeted the entire staff! Once we were seated we were given menu's time look the menu.When finally came time order; I ended going the Karaka-Men ($ 16) my friend chose the Shiromaru New York ($ 17). Since the Karaka-Men advertised a``spicy""dish I excited have something would've warmed up . BE WARNED; even though the dish is delicious ;'s spicy I hoped be: (Probably a 4/10 on the``spicy""richter scale.The service alright a well! Our server sat u told u we any question feel free ask . Shen't hover also gave u ample time throughout the meal to enjoy our food . Overall this is a great place to go you're the St. Marks - NYU area are looking some filling ramen .

Add a decor black wall; bamboo ornament; white red flag kanji's writing over...It make experience whole! The menu not extensive's acceptable a first timer . Since lady seating table front (Which In't know we ended sharing table 4 couple) eating some sort bun; I asked the Ippudo Buns vegetable ($ 9 USD 2 bun). The dough delicious the fried vegetable patty inside so tasty can't taste vegetable used mistakenly gave you pork . Since I'm a recovering carnivore-holic; tasting 2 slice pork made the best the soup me! To add the experience; imported Asahi dry beer ($ 8) had.For the main course I asked advice since noodle not favorite food...This because are (my opinion) a bunch pasta lot flavored water...At least's what I've until today . I ate Japan noodle deemed be the best Japan some people the country left completely unsurprised . When asked the lady the ordered noodle pointed the Akamaru Modern ($ 15) when asked me if I could eat spicy (My Mexican mustache must given me) I nodded; she recommended the Karaka-Men ($ 16). She offered add egg $2 USD . Since the egg (according to her )n't alter the flavor much; I decided to go it and it a great decision!

2851,29,There time I considered flipping top-two rating Ipuddo Totto; I could never - Ipuddo always top NYC ramen list despite year 30 different place I've tried.I typically go tonkotsu (dish) the shoyu; the shoyu pretty good well . Their creamy appropriately salty broth my opinion the best the city . The pork chasu piece also delicious . The noodle also good . It's combination make Ipuddo stand the rest class with Totto . I also enjoy pork bun . I used think Momofuku neck neck the best I've the city.The décor pretty cool . Visitors out the town love coming experiencing the atmosphere . Yes; have notoriously long wait . Two suggestion . If know will eat that evening; come 1.5 hour think'll eat and put name; walk around the East Village; maybe grab drink a dive bar . Other suggestion go a snow storm's cold outside (le 10 degreesF) - wait time drop significantly when that happens . Wait time Totto the hand very short comparatively; when going Ramen spur the moment; I typically end going Totto . Ipuddo a NYC staple.FYI my own personal rating system and ranking list some ramen place NYC 5=worth a trip; something you'll crave4=worth getting only you're already in the area3=only worth if's free/discounted; worth paying full price2=would even eat it if free; waste stomach space1=the place shut downPlaces also ranked in order (Ipuddo better than Totto; etc.).

2864,29,Needless say; Ippudo still popular ever . With 9; 000 review (counting); global chain continues thrive attract many diner . Although location city; I prefer East Village branch first overseas Ippudo ever opened (slowly began world domination). But I digress.Ippudo known tonkotsu ramen - certainly; cult follower crave . As lifelong lover shoyu ramen; I find Ippudo's shoyu-broth lack depth complex balance sweet; salty; umami . Furthermore; I question use the signature thin; straight noodle shoyu ramen . While work heavier ramen like the tonkotsu; I'm sure I say the same shoyu ramen.Although ramen get the attention Ippudo; appetizer not dismissed . I adore their bun . My favorite the Ippudo Bun eggplant . The combination crispy fried eggplant sweet salty sauce; encased inside soft fluffy bun an absolute perfection . I not recommend this dish enough; I would dine Ippudo for these.As many review mentioned; the wait quite painful .

Don't get wrong though - I think certain people are red super spicy food could find place decent . Hence Three star seem right Perhaps's ordered two three dish sweet (spicy!). We dan dan noodle start shared braised fish filet water spinach garlic Starting dan dan noodle - okay . Not best missing tingly flavor most dan dan noodle have...definitely the sweeter side Braised fish bean sauce (Chinese it's something like 'dou ban yi') - sweet . Also we asked the waiter fish fillet fried ordering...said...it wa fried . No big deal probably would have gotten whole fish instead . I like they had a different fish menu option chose . Though sweet it wa still okay Water spinach garlic - probably the better dish three's I love veggie and it wan't salty .

2941,30,It's taken long time actually write review; only I've busy eating . I lunch most day this summer can say certainty amazing food consistently good.Their hot sour soup their steamed rice both simple good . Their Beef string bean lunch dry crisp an excellent flavor . It could use tad beef; also true their Beef Asian Chili lunch dinner - crisp vegetable; amazing bit savory; tender beef . Their Guangzhou chicken offer complex flavor freshest; snap-in-your-mouth bamboo shoot like I've never anywhere else; just hint sweetness . The three pepper chicken best all chongqing-chicken-style dish I've ever; just the right amount cornstarch crisp; spice; seasoning each piece chicken diced amongst green red pepper . The food is consistent across lunch; dinner; weekend . They offer alcohol well some mixed non-alcoholic drink; coke straight the headquarters Georgia; really taste better . Diners eating at dinner get piece gum the meal . It's Sichuan; Americanized Chinese; don't expect a fortune cookie . I'd accept orange slice though; along my gum . I've never a bad meal . The staff grown accustomed u eating spicy food everyday; are always quick seat u; give u water; turn the fan towards because I'm always hot . They know'll want coke; probably the same meal we most day - though they'll wait confirm case I want try something new.,5.0 star rating
2942,30,I tend judge restaurant way deliver upon simplicity . I read I think Daniel Boulud tested aspiring chef simply asking create omelette . I get across cuisine around world.Based wonderful recommendation; I ate Chow House went simple you get--cold sesame noodle broccoli garlic sauce bit fried tofu . Firstly; presentation simple; beautiful proportional . These may best cold noodle I've--room temperature actually; too think overwhelming; bit heat made delicious interesting . The broccoli tofu perfectly prepared; perfectly presented perfectly seasoned . I eye balled people around--saw same across spectrum dishes.It tell a full house wa one Indian couple; me (gringo Italian American) everyone else wa Chinese Chinese heritage.I've found David Chiang's Ugly Delicious Netflix; especially episode fried rice; provocative . For reason; the mind boggling wonderful sensitive cuisine that Chinese (silly a there 1000 different Chinese cuisine) think of a satisfaction food . Easy to eat; rich; satisfying rice noodle . But in fact; of the most interesting special food earth.Chow House is not a Michelin place; decor is very simple dish simple traditional . But wa a sublime wonderful eating experience.,5.0 star rating

2946,30,Hidden Gem! I came this place search some reasonably priced; high quality dumpling . I found much!!! They offered lunch special general tso's chicken; I could refuse (serve lunch 4!!!). I ended ordering shrimp dumpling general tso's chicken lunch special . I never such high quality asian food such reasonable price!!!! I completely blown away how well flavored everything . Nothing too overpowering . The dumpling amazing!!! The general tso's chicken served two spring roll soup white rice . I got spring roll friend chose hot sour soup . However; I ended trying very pleased . The chickenn't stringy sticky like low quality place often make . Pure white meat chicken lightly fried topped sweet/spicy based sauce . The sauce not oily did make feel sick . I could tell made finest ingredient . Now; best part this place the decor the ambiance . The server amazing (much I left a 40% tip). They constantly making sure enough water and accommodated of need . We even got free gum the check! There a funny moment; upon seeing I had trouble using chopstick; the hostess asked if I needed a fork . I wa a little embarrassed and refused the offer; wa grateful know that she wanted my dining experience to be convenient possible . 10/10!!!!,5.0 star rating
2947,30,I came St Patrick's Day night restaurant surprisingly quiet quickly filled . I say without reservation some best Chinese food I've city . We ordered West Lake beef soup (two); shredded potato; shuizhu yu (the classic Sichuan spicy fish dish); snow pea leaf . West Lake Beef Soup - although supposedly two; portion easily serve 3-4 people (great--pleasen't change). It's hearty yet surprisingly light soup is absolutely perfect cold winter night . Shredded potato - a classic Northern Chinese dish; I think this done wellSpicy Sichuan Fish - Great . Minor hiccup aside (the owner / bos lady quickly rectified); I thought the portion size wa generous the flavor relatively pointSnow pea leaf - can't go wrong . It's on the smaller end perfectly acceptableI like this restaurant sits squarely the middle west village; right in the bustle the NYU campus . Sandwiched smoke shop Irish pub; Chow House is a great addition the neighborhood I'd highly recommend it.,5.0 star rating

Don't eat the dried red pepper unless you normally eat a lot habaneros . I like pair dish with a veggie side; like stir fried string bean pea shoots.Avoid the house tea .

2952,30,This neat little szechuan spot village . I came Wednesday night we ordered regular pork soup dumpling; diced rabbit appetizer; twice cooked pork; sauteed pea shoots.Their soup dumpling rather thick skin; comparatively soup dumpling place . It make bit chewy doughy take away flavor soup meat . The biggest problem these soup dumpling though spoon give soup dumpling small . It smaller what would usually get Chinese restaurant serving soup dumpling . This make difficult for dumpling balance spoon for a person take a bite the skin suck the soup.The diced rabbit appetizer extremely bony . In't mind bone; every bite bone . I felt like the bone meat ratio 50/50 even worse . They bone also pointy splintered; this need be chewed care delicacy . It also spicy anything else; while I eating I kept trying find variation the flavor . There no nuance this dish cumbersome eat.The twice cooked pork tender I've at other restaurant New York . The flavor profile this dish also that it mostly spicy . I personally enjoy spicy food thisn't bother a lot; some complexity variation flavor profile a dish keep it interesting; while pork; onion; pepper this dish; everything or le tasted the same; at least the vegetable crisp.The sauteed pea shoot easily the best dish this meal . The vegetable fresh they generous on the garlic oil . Great eat rice.The service good; the food came really quick . Their tea nice floral . It's quite a large space the table nice large never feel like you are too close other diner . Overall not a bad spot you need a szechuan fix the village; the style of food is similar other restaurant Chinatown.,3.0 star rating

Had right amount kick it; all spice blended well together . Came a side white brown rice . Huge amount tofu.- Smoked Tea Duck: another amazing dish; the duck cooked perfectly; a large amount meat the crispy skin add texture . Came 4 bun; enough stuff the duck; additional bun necessary .50 cent (though didn't need). Hoisin sauce added some nice flavor well.- General Tso's Chicken: also really good; a nice amount white meat ;n't overly stir-fried . Perfect amount sauce had a small side steamed broccoli.Price (4/5) - The duck a little expensive the dish ($ 21); everything very reasonably priced (Tofu wa $11 Chicken wa $13) All all; a great dinner!

Menu offered smattering drunk food classic including scallion pancake (surprisingly delicate; underfried); fried dumpling; General Tso's chicken . These juxtaposed along a lengthy fish section; along a pretty reasonable spicy beef noodle soup.Beef noodle soup rich; maybe lacked a bit the star anise flavor the Taiwanese inlaws . Walnut shrimp overpowered a heavy dose sweet Kewpie-mayonnaise-based sauce . Tea duck (Peking duck?) fried rice good; tasty morsel duck; might well spring the bona fide tea duck entree more concentrated taste.Generally; spice rating legitimate - one chili pepper rating (mild?) pack a pretty solid punch . Mapo tofu wa flavorful; required a couple beer wash the fire.,4.0 star rating

2960,30,I've happily supporting Chow House regular since ha opened last winter; unfortunately terrible lunch experience couple weekend ago; I never returning . I known sign leave two male server I regularly see recognize restaurant I stopped quick lunch early Saturday afternoon . Instead; young female seemed constantly confused everything going young male obviously give sh*t anything going . Things went downhill here . I ordered lunch special menu--shredded pork garlic sauce . My friend ordered dish two week prior I very pleased it light savory taste . I customer restaurant female server took order--spicy; said could accommodate . It took a half hour receive food; came one sitting . Usually; I would first receive the soup; then entree would come a bit . Not; she also order *entirely* wrong--came not pork garlic sauce; some beef dish . I politely notified; reminded nicely order; sent the dish back . When dish finally came ten fifteen minute later; drenched a thick sauce I not see my friend the dish . To describe my food *disgusting* would an understatement . I one bite immediately thought I would get diabetes the unexpected; overwhelming sweetness came the dish . The entire thing drenched some sort syrup . I have heard story if employee a Chinese restaurant were disgruntled the customer; would secretly add extra sugar the food f*ck . Unfortunately; seems like I fallen victim this scheme; I thought I immune; since I'm Chinese . I wa so disappointed I immediately stood; asked the check; began packing leave . The young male whon't give a sh*t asked if I liked my food I told taste terrible In't like at all . He shrugged . They did nothing my dissatisfaction . The young female had the gall tell she did a favor not charging me for the beef . Why I wa nice enough still tip them AND pay for my meal; I never know . Perhaps it wa I came an early morning yoga class; maybe . What a waste time money . I say though that I miss pork dumpling - were pretty tasty . But's always that dumpling place around the corner Sullivan that ha consistent; reliable; quick . Goodbye; Chow House - I enjoyed food; it wa short-lived . My friend and I have find another sit-down establishment that open at 11 a weekend morning . A year ago; seeing the constant turnover your space opened; were talking how sincerely hoped you would here to stay . Now; I care le.,1.0 star rating

The night already ruined my friend whose birthday celebrating offered leave felt so uncomfortable service . But we decided stay . The food arrived it bland: the falafel dry; zatar naan oily . We ordered food I particularly asked gnocchi without bacon . Guess? I got plate topped bacon bit . My friend got a paella half the pan filled a weird tasting looking black sauce . While people still working their food; server asked u the dessert menu; wa told we were not done the food 1 minute later he just put a check our table without even asking we'd like more drinks.Another weird thing this place that take AmEx cash . Seriously??? Plus the size their tapa way smaller comparing other tapa place Manhattan . Sorry; Alta; I not back will not recommend to anyone.,2.0 star rating

The burrata beet salad probably favorite the dish . The meatball definitely least favorite . All the food very fresh a wonderful presentation . The plate all came pretty quickly; worked nicely we so hungry . We split a bottle white wine resembled a chardonnay . The service definitely a little wonky . My friend had a dirty glass asked a new one still totally clean . The waiter kind terse/abrupt . It very busy dinner; there wan't a very welcoming atmosphere . There so many dish I definitely would ordered...zatarr naan; foie gras mousse; grilled octopus . Next time!! Definitely come back.,4.0 star rating
3006,25,Alta ton good review made u go ahead make reservation my birthday dinner . When arrived looked menu; realized apparently take cash american express! What kind restaurant operates solely amex? This large inconvenience address boldly their website . My husband to step during the dinner & go withdraw money . The food rather meh . The wine I ordered wa pricey; tasted like a cheap 5 $bottle wine . The dish ended liking the rissoto the eggplant dish.The food quality & flavor definitely better the cost they charge . The ambience a bit nice; a rustic & rather a romantic feel; I would surely go again.,3.0 star rating
3007,25,Why it long? This place always my radar I live close; why? In't know food amazing . The ambiance equally lovely . However one the coldest night the year; gorgeous old building is drafty . Be sure start lovely cocktail; created the friendly bartender . Of course jump their luscious wine list . Try the octopus a la plancha . So tender . The beet; your ordinary beet salad . So many creative mushroom dish however none my dining partner eat funghi so I skipped all . The short rib lamb meatball big hit . We ordered double the goat cheese ball fried potato . We 4 the dessert . Can't wait come back eat everything else.,4.0 star rating

3009,25,"Came weekend expecting full lucky last minute reservation accommodated! I'll start what's great place first: Pros: - last minute re accommodated . We even seated early! - pretty good/robust wine list - service pretty good; waitress attentive even though restaurant fairly packed-the burrata delicious! My friend ordered short rib beet infused pasta loved well! - great interior vibe design ;'s even fireplace back! Could really romantic date . And con: - bread table...maybe minor complaint expecting bread given other comparable American dining venue offer...- a other review state; don't take other credit Amex cash course . Blah . Annoying . But run atm literally block beforehand . - food honestly kind mediocre me . It's``tapa""style so everything's smaller meant be shared BUT ordered the mushroom flatbread be sharedn't even sliced u...it wa literally one long flatbread melted cheese mushroom top . Again; a huge hassle a bit annoying you're friend a seated dinner you stop conversation devote attention cutting the flatbread- ambiance wan't great*...the customer; opinion; a mix middle older aged couple doing thang being respectful everyone else; then a couple college kids/grown-men-who-wish-they-were-still-in-college kid loud rowdy . We sat next a table about 10 men dressed button down looked like came work they were literally pounding the table urging other drink . This prob every night certainly the fault the restaurant; just wanted to describe experience . I could hardly hear friend talking let alone own voice! We sat the back the fireplace; if we sat on the second floor by the front bar we think experience would have been better! *just want to reiterate this just reflective my experience on one night . I assume the customer are not usually like this every night . The restaurant also no way fault for their customer' behavior whatsoever . Just my description.",3.0 star rating

While give color the dish; Itn't taste good; take away the foie gras . The ricotta gnocchi amazing; the braised short rib just ok - although the pasta the short rib dish amazing; could made it little pasta dish . Besides a very chipped plate one the dish; a huge noisy group the next table; the experience quite good.,4.0 star rating

I booked company dinner 16 people seated comfortably.I loved atmosphere Alta - busy; not crazy loud; lighting overall mood perfect Thursday evening dinner . The ambience would perfect date . We pretty much one waiter entire party whole night; he managed pretty well; I must say . They some signature drink numbered - our table got #6 . They also selection craft beer available well.I fortunate enough order``shebang""- basically entire menu; $520 . We also ordered the dessert . I counted ;'s literally 45 dish that ordered - twice . For group 16; 2 of the shebang fed u well . I can't say I've ever tried so many dish one sitting - even better a tasting menu! I would definitely suggest ordering everything the menu your part large enough - I the calculation you save a dollars.Obviously; tried way many dish describe all; the few that stood me colleague the following; decided were``must get"": - Fried goat cheese and honey- Short rib + beet noodles- Foie gras- Fried hen of the wood (a mushroom) - BRUSSEL SPROUTS (everyone raving these Brussel sprout - come close competition the Brussel sprout L'Artusi) - Paella- Mushroom flatbread (it smell funky) - Lamb tagine- Black truffle burrata- Lamb meatballsFor dessert; we tried all . However; really got u going the apple fritter ice cream sundae thing . SO GOOD we ordered . You have get this! Everything else (labne cheesecake; chocolate cake; baked Alaska; trio sorbet) nothing compared to the apple fritter.For a tapa place; Alta get 5 star my book for having a massive; diverse menu that anyone enjoy . Having tried the entire menu; I'd say I didn't like the pork belly . Everything else wa delicious and it wa topped nicely a delicious dessert.",5.0 star rating

Our server amazingly helpful advising u what wine standouts their extensive wine list fell within price looking spend bottle . They were also accommodating allergy - asked the paella without clam specifically they said problem . The decor feel of the place reminds of a tavern Spain Portugal . I suggest starting the paella ('s filling) then moving meat seafood veggie . We tried the lamb meatball; pork empanadas; scallop; hen the wood; falafel cumin chicken wing . Delicious really well crafted food . Pork empanadas were really good (I grew eating so I have higher standard them!) Can't wait to go back!

It's also kinda loud hard hear what your date saying (maybe romantic setting first date're 4 month still want impress - check place! hah) ALSO; IMPT: They take AMEX cash . Hope've rolling the dough recently . The restaurant located a picturesque townhouse the West Village claim only buy local grower other trusted purveyor . They recommend 2-3 tapa per person plate range $10-20 so thing add . The food's remarkably tasty!!! And you can choose a wide variety meat; seafood vegetable a Mediterranean flair . We ordered: Octopus a la plancha - grilled octopus toasted chickpea a green cilantro sauce . Not sure if worth $18 it a large piece octopus! I like the chickpeas-octopus-green sauce comboMushroom flatbread - dry pretty blandBraised short rib - HIGHLY RECOMMEND . If you get anything; get the braised short rib pasta . The dish a huge piece tender short rib a delicious unique beet infused pappardelle pasta . THE BEET INFUSED PASTA WAS AMAZING . Think favorite dish the night . Fried goat cheese - This wa highly recommended Yelpers In't think it wa special . The wild lavender honey tasted delicious the cheese (Why every restaurant super lavender honey day!??!)

3084,25,"It's over year since I fabulous birthday dinner Cata; Alta's sister restaurant . My experience kind wonderful I still remember--quite vividly; fact--number dish I tried . Yet somehow; Alta--older two restaurant--grown stale ever-growing restaurant bookmark . Newer; less-reviewed spot kept shooting top; Alta became neglected . Thankfully; I say great joy Alta finally checked . Though different vibe Cata; execution Alta; ; stellar it sister spot . The food creative; varied; beautiful; well-balanced delicious . And space remarkable it right! Perhaps one reason I forgot Alta it concealment . Despite popular area; Alta hidden predominately residential block . A bit searching involved . But've entered; know've arrived right place . The space seems like flipped apartment building: three floor connected two old-school; narrow; carpet-clad staircase . While first two floor bit like Cata (`` hip""; dark); third floor feel like living room your treasured relative . This floor happened dine . While I still somewhat wish seated elsewhere (I enjoy dark lighting; despite not much food photo); third floor cozy intriguing . And somehow; service efficient despite sheer size venue . The one underwhelming area (I'm getting the way first) the cocktail menu . Whereas Cata separate cocktail menu *just* G & Ts (my favorite drink; I got lucky); the Alta menu more austere . Not many option; nothing notable . The one highlight the Lavender Collins; refreshing gin drink perfect getting the night started . My advice is start a lighter cocktail're the mood liquor; switch wine (contrast; *great* wine selection) the food start arrive.The food menu Alta is vast . I always a difficult time choosing tapa spot; menu particularly heart-wrenching . Everything just looked superb; judging what ultimately order; probably was/is . There's something everyone: seafood; veggie; tartares/crudos; meat; cured dish; grain . Important note: AMEX AND CASH ONLY . BS; my opinion ;'s excusable . Excellent Eats;: Grilled Octopus w/ blistered bean; kalamata olive celery salad: AI'm spoiled come octopus; mean I also high standard . This yummy tentacle definitely there some the better preparation I've . Cooked perfectly; crispy skin; flavorful . The salad beneath a extra hidden piece meat there; when you start lament the dish's conclusion.Salmon Tartare w/ truffle; black rice crisp; salmon roe: A+There's something tartare . I can't get enough it; it's plate like keep me consuming a questionable amount raw fish . Simple; delicate; delectable beautifully presented . The salmon roe top felt downright luxurious . If you can; try eat crisp multiple bite . Crispy Okra Salad w/ heirloom tomato; cucumber; vadouvan; basil: A-Peculiar dish a tapa restaurant; I'm not complaining . We order brussels sprout almost every time dine out; decided opt the okra our veggie . Didn't blow me away it more solid . Fantastic flavor texture a great interlude diving back more meat.Spanish Mackerel Saor w/ currant; pine nut; clove; spanish onion: AI hesitant ordering a cured dish given the wide array other choice; I'm wholly satisfied this decision . Each bite wa solid complex with ton flavor . Tasteful; aesthetically pleasing a nice change pace what I'm used ordering out.Porcini-Braised Short Rib w/ spelt pasta; beet puree; horseradish: A+I'm glad got devour this towards the end our night Alta I hope remember it day week and year come . Melt-in-your-mouth good . And for a red meat dish; component refreshingly healthy . The flavor worked together the harmonious harmony; there is such a superlative . The perfect amount horseradish; can difficult to execute.Bacon-Wrapped Dates largueta almond: A+++Usually one receives bacon-wrapped date the beginning a meal; we started to worry a certain point that our order been forgotten . But thank god we received it last; these no question the best bacon-wrapped date I've ever consumed . The almond in the center were *the* pleasant surprise . We didn't need dessert these: pure indulgence.",5.0 star rating

The menu perhaps a bit overpriced how small the dish were; even tapa standard; everyone happy leaving the restaurant . The waiter knowledgeable and the restaurant a really cool vibe inside .

A u arrived early; decided take advantage their happy hour bar ($ 8 house red/white wine).When seated; started browsing menu lot thing popped at u . Here thing we ordered: Salmon tartare (truffle; black rice crisp; salmon roe) - probably best one . The salmon tasted fresh black rice crisp complemented fish well . However; none u expecting portion tiny . It three bite-sized rice cracker salmon . But wa good we ended ordering secondsPEI mussel (harissa broth; preserved lemon; cilantro) - nothing special . I feel like I probably make at home . Seems taste simple enoughPaella (crispy saffron rice; mussel; clam; shrimp; chorizo) -n't much flavor a I'd expect paella have . Also; rice wa a bit mushyLamb meatball (charred red pepper sauce; labne) - wa dry sidePorcini braised short rib (spelt pasta; beet puree; horseradish) - didn't try the short rib the pappardelle whatever sheet pasta came wa pretty goodFoie gras terrine (smoked eel; plum mostarda) - wa first time trying foie gras . I got mixed with pate my taste bud were definitely surprised upon first bite . In't think I like foie gras - fatty meRoasted pork belly (charmoula; lollipop kale; garnet yam) - weird leftover taste . You'd be better grabbing some from Chinatown - half the price; double the flavor; triple the portionIf're looking have a full satisfying meal; Alta not it . But're looking try a bit of everything (you're the mood splurge; these dish add QUICK) maybe you'll like this place . Just expect the dish be hit miss.Tip - cash Amex,2.0 star rating

My party two able get seated immediately 7 Friday night without reservation; rare I highly recommend getting earlier restaurant nearly empty 7 got exponentially crowded 7 . It's perfect spot catch friend; take date; come family.The food fairly underwhelming warm; had sitting awhile . Most item tasted pre-made heated before placing a plate fantastic decoration cover up . Between two u ordered:1 . Housemade parker roll (garlic roll with butter): worst item ordered . The roll tasted like stale old bread you microwave a second long microwave come crusty hard . The flavor came garlic . 2 . Roasted beet: one personal favorite; though my friend found underwhelming . The beet probably nothing special I loved the goat cheese panna cotta can't stop thinking; it definitely pulled the plate together.3 .``Paella"": another one my favorite it actually warm tasted like it freshly cooked . The seafood chorizo generous . Of course it doen't taste like actual Spanish paella's you're looking; it flavorful . It wa one the largest portion among the dish tried enough for a person a standalone dish if you issue sharing (this is 100% a sharing place!).4 . Ricotta gnocchi: I liked the texture the gnocchi In't find the dish flavorful . It wan't memorable all.5 . Lamb tagine: this wa fantastic relative most the dish ordered; ; nothing like actual tagine . The lamb wa generous the overall dish wa good; not something stood either.Overall; is not a single item the one ordered that I would order again .

3114,25,We very looking forward coming menu look amazing whole visit disappointing . The food came fast couldn't believe! We got appetizer even we got drink . The blooming mushroom kind rough . Didn't taste so good . Dates just ok. Burrata also pretty chewy; we eat burrata the time . Tiny bread basket's extra $. No bread offered . Paella not good well; barely rice . The Tina tartar so weird . That's item's hard go screw but managed . The good thing the dessert; the candy bar . Delicious . Service just blah . The waitress seemed new . And not excepting Visa so weird . Also; the food presentation playing could so much better.,2.0 star rating

Good people want taste things.Tried foie grad salmon tarte; the classic; special.Also tried fried goat cheese dipped honey; good.I liked the braised rib; smooth tender; paired noodle; soaked gravy orange scent.The seafood paella good; like seafood stew paella there more seafood rice good.Very fresh seasoned the right point.Wine list is mostly Spain I have no idea to order turned fine.Not very crowded a Friday night.A little expensive u to go out for wine dessert . Overall I would recommend it for date night friend hangout.,5.0 star rating

On own merit none terrible; simply at the same level the rest the - ahem - 40 dishes.The whole shebang obviously followed an order each dessert . Yes; I tried all again; the walnut rosehip sundae hand the winner: decadent yet airy . The winter sorbet crammed cool flavor well; especially the cassis (blackcurrant).

The inside restaurant beautiful food quite good; the service be lacking; the bill get pricey; the restaurant get loud can't really hear the people around you . For specific dish; get the rotisserie chicken the green sauce . The lomo saltado good; $28 per plate ;'s worth . Fries good the green sauce are the fried plantain (come it flavorful sauce). The aji de gallina tasty well; a nice change flavor the dish . It's also a much better deal the lomo saltado .

3172,31,My history Pio Pio go back super far...I remember first time I ever Pio Pio probably 10 year ago young teenager; left big impression since Peruvian chicken novel concept me; chicken I back wa pretty incredible relative I eaten until point time.Moving city; I'm lucky live close place the Pio Pio chain; after going back few time; I still think Pio Pio's food quite good . Theren't lot place find Peruvian chicken ;'ve never; I'd highly recommend it . The chicken roasted perfection come lot juicy/tender a lot chicken might find a restaurant . In addition; it's seasoned a bit differently; the rest the option also a Peruvian flair expose new flavor dish variant a good way.No matter what; probably get Juanita's chicken; whether it part a combo . A whole chicken should feed 2 pretty well; even it be a lot if get other stuff it . The combo pretty good; though I've personally found better luck sometimes picking choosing the exact item I want side (price work way). I'd opt the Matador Combo the Peruvian Combo value; it's good to experience the full range offering . Their salchipapas are a bit a guilty pleasure mine; I honestly like fry a lot some reason . Make sure to try their sauce well; they're what you might usually find well.When people ask me recommendation for a group or for something new; this ha become go-to place it's consistent quality represents something nice isn't European/Asian/American (US).,4.0 star rating
3173,31,Close Theater District; I checked Pio Pio post theatre dinner . Atmosphere cool dark light; pretty crammed . Food tasty I not overly impressed enough come . It lacked a special wow factor; fit bill you're looking standard Peruvian food . I personally expecting given trendy image Pio Pio emulates . Portions large shareable; work well larger party . Prices very fair NYC overall good value.,3.0 star rating

We told front we 1 hour 45 minute eat; definitely more than enough time . We ordered seafood dish rice; steam veggie; fry hot dog; half chicken . Everything came great . The taste just phenomenal . Everything finished plate super clean we ate . One thing happened me reason I didnt give place 5 star a smart part my tooth; inside chipped . I wa eating mussel; I took the mussel meat the shell; then chomp; I bit something a little hard; wa either sand; a tiny stone; a piece the shell still attached the mussel . At the time; I didnt know happened . But wasnt a bite later; I felt different; rough; unfamiliar texture my teeth . Itn't hurt; it stilln't . This might actually happened any restaurant even home . But the fact it happened and never happened to me anywhere else; is the reason I'm giving place 3 star . Food wa amazing; just careful biting on food; eat with caution.,3.0 star rating

3179,31,Pio Pio solid; thing held back being 4-star experience.The Hell's Kitchen location small upfront seating section; lead a large; almost cavernous back room seat a ton people . It's interesting fun room architecturally; make a shame's extremely loud . Loud point altering enjoyment meal; hard hear person across you without shouting loud . It's a shame have mention; you be aware.The food range pretty good . I definitely enjoyed the ceviches (tried several); they some the strongest part the meal . The cold potato dish mediocre bland - mayben't thing? The empanada appetizer pretty good . The salchipapa appetizer just kinda good . It sounded fun - hot dog slice cut among french fry . But's nothing to it; it come somewhat uninspired needing flavor; a it's literally just cut hot dog slice no sauce in a pile fry . The chicken tasty well-cooked . I had an ok time eating there; unfortunately the noise level just way high; the food good not good it would override factor.,3.0 star rating
3180,31,Food always good I've noticed service meh unless're loud demanding - I not.This second time going boyfriend first . Both time; I experienced lack attention customer service . It kinda busy should have an excuse? I not sure . Especially hostess not tell u they short staffed someone would u shortly . My boyfriend chase waiter can put our order get water . We ordered two cocktail; Calamari; Ceviche Mixto; Tostones; Corvina A lo Macho; avocado salad chocolate cake dessert . The cocktail pretty strong . I stopped drinking mine much me . No complaint; I weak . Tostones die . I love from . None our dish came we ordered side Tostones . The waiter told u lot food (); that not stop u! Calamari good . It breaded well crunchy . The quantity good two people . Corvina lo macho meant two people . The saffron rice amazing (don't really like yellow rice this delish). The seafood sauce amazing . Not too spicy but had a kick . Avocado Salad refreshing next the Ceviche . Cecivhe wa very sour me . That's of my own taste bud if like sour; I think it will perfect! If don't are sensitive; just make sure scoop the seafood on a separate plate eat it from rather letting it marinate the sauce . Will always go back to pio pio but will also consider customer service recommending to friends/colleagues . tldr; Food Service (this case) Need to be v patient food at least get your order taken.If one giving you attention; get and ask.Food delicious so you will leave with a happy belly.,4.0 star rating

3190,31,The place crowded loud; super cold night . So; I imagine crowded can get on normal weekend night . It's dim lighted (fancy tyype lighting; ya know) restaurant I still felt I could relax dine informal . The staff pretty nice; helpful . We ordered signature half chicken (dark piece). I would highly recommend this - It crispy glazed skin juicy chicken meat . Between hubby I; half not enough we ordered another half . I think dark piece tastier . We also ordered appetizer; shrimp avacado . This a cold appetizer; had only two piece shrimp; around $18 . I felt appetizer not worth it; the flavor didn't come together - mashed avacado cold flowery tasting sauce two piece cold shrimp . We also ordered a side plaintains wa okay; good a side dish the chicken . Overall; I would recommend sticking their half/quarter/whole chicken (dark piece) getting a side a calamari; fry; plantain; etc . The fancier expensive dish; I think not worth it.,4.0 star rating

I got Ahi de Gallina; my favorite Peruvian dish feature chicken creamy yellow sauce . Peruvian cuisine known chicken; I figured a place called Pio Pio (the sound chicken make) would great chicken . I sadly disappointed the chicken my Ahi de Gallina it dry . It felt like someone shredded some dry rotisserie chicken chucked it in the sauce instead cooking it all together so the flavor could really settle the chicken could soak the cream properly . Everyone else enjoyed their dish; all party agreed the Ahi de Gallina a bit a disappointment.,3.0 star rating

It my first time try Tiradito Mixto (Peruvian Sashimi) - looking taste interesting it brand new experience. ## Drink: N/ACame for lunch tried drink yet. ## Service : 4/5Good service . Stuffs nice friendly . The problem order serviced late; even though restaurant really crowded . ## Atmosphere : 3.5/5Good atmosphere . The entrance look like chic boutique hotel; inside actually way spacious I thought (two story). The only suggestion I would have is that sample food picture yelp helpful do not really look tasty elegant . I feel wa a big discrepancy the menu yelp actual interior the restaurant . ## Cost Performance : 2.5/5Foods on average a bit pricy end . Most of lunch menu cost $28.,4.0 star rating

They bumped my husband few time he eating never offered apology . It incredibly rude part staff they aware how disruptive this . Also I feel when something called the``chef's table""this should inclusive experience the chef should least bit a show- the case because this sitting this location ill advised . SERVICE: As mentioned I much felt the service lacking overall . We ask the free bread white bean spread; came appetizer (got the crostini felt duplicative).

It a nice glass wine would been good enjoy the complimentary bread/crostini appetizer (n't get the chance though) Appetizer: We the Crostini Roasted Garlic . It is whole piece garlic on top grilled bread; making it difficult eat a they fall right of the bread . I thought the roasted garlic would least a paste . Dinner: We shared the Monday risotto- Zuppa; Speck Goat Cheese; the``Priest Strangler""; of were underwhelming once presented with them I felt wa much to the dish to warrant the $17.95 $20.95 price per dish; respectively .

I'm sure they charged u the bill wa so confusing.Overall; it wa around $80 per person tip; obviously a good price the amount food wine ordered together; when look each individual item; I actually think this restaurant overpriced for what it is.Also; the restaurant is cash - VERY annoying; especially such a large group.,3.0 star rating
3282,32,"I extremely underwhelmed this restaurant . I visiting NY``foodie""trip this Supper highly recommended cousin life NY . Disclaimer - I'm Italian travel Italy yearly perhaps my standard high.The reason I decided go that were offering white truffle . I love Piemonte anytime I my hand white truffle I go (NoMad few day earlier). I ordered tajarin nothing resembling tajarin (believe wa papardelle) wa soggy spoonful melted butter . Amongst worst Italian dinner I've ever city . We better Italian option Arizona . We get a buffalo mozzarella mushroom salad were fine . The truffle it self seemed fresh enough . Service wa also mediocre . Won't go back traveling in NY.",2.0 star rating

3284,32,Whenever people ask what's worst place I've eaten; mind automatically go straight Supper . I really shocked well-reviewed restaurant could offer such poor food service . My guest I seated outside a busy Friday night; fine since told wait indoor table would much longer . The issue immediately forgotten . It took 20 minute waiter realize we were outside taking order; another hour (yes; an HOUR) them bring penne al vodka I ordered . Not entire dish covered cheese; pasta wa cold the time came the pasta tasted uncooked rather al dente . Rather order something else; I decided leave; especially since the waitern't come back check on u at least another 30 minute since the food arrived . I understand this place pretty popular; and I'm sure the waiter wa overwhelmed the amount people the restaurant; that still excuse the lack adequate service . I actually go the restaurant to ask the check since I knew would a before the waiter realized that we were still outside.,1.0 star rating
3285,32,Lemon pasta: I expecting very lemony; maybe even garlic taste; like dessert lemon . It reminded flavor of lemon pound cake . Not impressed . Noodles cooked perfection . Sunday sauce pasta dish: delicious; noodle needed be cooked little more; were hard . I like the little spiciness it.Black salt caesar salad: boring . A chopped romaine piece tossed it dressing . No crouton anything else - romaine...Great price; nice service cozy atmosphere . Our bill $130 tip we 4 drink; 1 salad; 2 entres dessert coffee.,3.0 star rating

3288,32,I excited try restaurant I heard great thing . We decided try friend's birthday . The first thing odd made reservation noted birthday; when arrived offered either a shared table a bizarre outdoor table shaped weirdlyn't sitting across each also right hostess . There ton better table I would think would offer a 30th birthday; oh well . We opted weird outdoor table.When sat we immediately got menu; took FOREVER anyone take drink order; again incredible amount time anyone take food order . The waiter seemed fluster likely too many table is his fault . They bring u extra round drink free end acknowledge awful service appreciated; we pretty ready get at that point.In term of food; bring bread a bean dip start . The bean dip wa actually pretty good . We were going order apps because it took long we went straight entree . I ordered the eggplant parm my two friend ordered the chicken parm the gnocchi . I thought the eggplant parm wa decent . The sauce wa a little bland very plain tomato based; it wa okay . My friend liked dish enough; none wowed us.Might been off night; there definitely better place go for similar food and vibe.,3.0 star rating

My friend already inquired assured completed party arrived plenty available space indoors--decided do a lap around block . I showed asked space two . The Eastern European accented lady asked I a reservation--I . She state'd able offer u my friend returned a table outdoors . Never offered a communal table seat; which plenty visible . When someone left the chef's table; she returned say I could sit the chef's table my party complete; addition sitting indoors.Then; happened . A white couple walked; she immediately offered a coveted spot the warm indoor communal table . Shen't even mention the outdoor seat . Why? Because 28 degree the heat lamp not adequate . I a grey hair I 10 year ago (I'm 34!). My skin still black; much smoother truly glow . My curl gorgeous ever . But; ladyn't know; I'm actual medical doctor (longer a medical student) I wayyy more green bill my pocket trade some pasta wine . The fact she wouldn't even offer a seat a table indoors when were clearly many available disappointing . I feel bad that I couldn't dine a place I'd likely a patron at longer she'd been working . It's 2019 I'm not quite sure strategic advantage restaurant in New York City think have gain discriminating this way . And it's bad; I'll miss the guy work there .

Since I the unique privilege trying both; I conclusively note that both very meh . The oil garlic pasta so salty that difficult eat - I absolutely love garlic I think it could been fine they used le salt . The pasta al limone; someone else noted; similar lemon pound cake pasta form; except le like eating a cake eating a lemon . It hard to finish my dish the lemon flavor so overpowering .

Let tell all happened could been avoided let u sit at table inside especially since they empty mostly entire time were . Anyways; entree I ordered risotto day amarone meaning's red wine risotto . That's fine's simple I know I would like . My boyfriend ordered timely priest strangler sausage . We also ordered two white wine pair . This place cash whichn't problem there bank everywhere for place ha wine list go triple digit a credit card system seemed make sense . No one want walk street New York at least outside eating amount cash around . We withdrew a certain amount if saw a wine we really enjoyed we would ordered but the cash make the wine list limited . We bread for the table I enjoyed the dipping sauce that came . It olive oil bean boyfriend I ended eating all . When the food came risotto a little underdone hard . I asked cooked a little and it came much better . This risotton't the best I ever and the amarone reminded me just salt . I want return another day the daily option sound better . My boyfriend priest strangler were delicious though! Definitely order it with sausage it make it much better . I kind of wish I ordered dish instead .

3330,32,"Closer 2.5 star . It's okay; okay . I dunno I sort expecting better.I'm criticizing fact space cramped you almost hear romantic conversation couple next you . I get's NYC's eating; I bone . My gripe twofold: (1) that food fine ONLY fine; yet's priced like's far better; (2) music that place??? The night I went; though musicn't overwhelmingly loud; loud enough u notice amount Maroon 5 Taylor Swift other Top 40 artist playing speaker . It didn't even remotely match not-crazy-romantic-but-romantic-enough; dimly lit; large-wine-list type atmosphere Supper try set . It jarring I heard few snicker``Shake It Off""began play couple enjoying date night out.When come food; first all; I like fact that they make own pasta; fresh homemade pasta far greater packaged's easy tell something is fresh made . So prop Supper that . But homemade pasta aside; I get equally basic similar-tasting Italian food (cheaper price) Olive Garden . Ouch.A couple thing ordered (In't remember wife ordered): We ordered SALMONE MARINATO an appetizer . It lightly cured salmon basil; arugula; lemon olive oil . There nothing bad; wa that I felt like I could've made the exact thing home . For my entree I ordered the SPAGHETTI POMODORO E BASILICO~ Basically; spaghetti tomato sauce . I the stracciatella an additional $9 . For $25 dish; it wa so-so small (I'm 125 pound even I'm saying it wa small). The stracciatella wa good; though~ strand-y added good amount creaminess the acidity the sauce.Overall; I feel like whoever run the kitchen is very technically good it come cooking; but can't doen't want push the food something better it could . And of the price Americans (perhaps just New Yorkers) willing pay Italian food; no matter how mediocre; place like Supper continue get away it . Either lower price stop phoning it in your food; Supper.",3.0 star rating
3331,32,We made reservation we arrived restaurant mostly empty reason waiter difficult time finding u table . The hostess carried u slew Empty table passed kitchen seat u next a wall ripped wallpaper . The appetizer took ever come mozzarella tomato . So I guess were truly making mozzarella scratch back . Although 'sn't actually taste way . I wait over half hour brought friend food waiter said totally forgot put my order . He apologized offered another glass wine I feel just comped one I drinking . But I'm sure sparkling Moscato knew they probably went sale more bottle for night . They started saying they didn't any because I wanted a glass not a bottle . Anyway the Moscato mysteriously appeared . My chicken Parmesan still took another 30 minute to arrive the table . I took one look the burn edge Said took this time still burnt the end . His response that's make good . I should i've since back immediately . But I wanted to make the best the night my friend I gave a try .

My boyfriend said are a staple dish every time go . Our entree served shortly . My fettuccine truffle were served a light buttery cream sauce; the server shaved the truffle to the pasta front me . The fettuccine cooked perfectly; the right amount . My boyfriend's chicken parmigiana also delicious; soft chicken tomato sauce atop . The spaghetti the side perfect .

We ordered potato tortellini in wild mushroom sauce spaghetti al limone; came highly recommended . So dish came I a little disappointed see the serving quite small . The spaghetti al limone; simple; delicious; lemony; buttery plenty Parmesan . While the tortellini wa good--loved the potato filling--the sauce wan't anything special; a little salty that.Those two entree two soda came over $50; so yeah I'm confused everyone else the pricing; way overpriced . Considering there were like 7 tortellini; sure the dish wa like $24? All the ingredient this entire meal could have cost than $3-4 . Although I would've liked to try of the other dish ;n't think's worth returning really.,3.0 star rating
3351,32,Came dinner friend . Have say feeling mixed.It Friday night fact could walk get table 4 great . First think noticed place small loud . With open kitchen kind inevitable gave one pas . The immediately strange thing cash . A cash fast food Chinese restaurant one thing respectable italian dinner establishment? Thats weird honestly inconvenient today day age . The weird thing price sparse two menu we got . One price . But other; seemed more predominant menu; completely lacking price . Suspect . We ordered burrata; I admit scrumptious . Very very good . We also got some sort white bean dip house appeared apply table . It mediocre . We ordered pasta dish chicken parm . Both pasta parm good . Not incredible; definitely tasty . Finally time to go we ask the check . And's the vague hidden pricing come play . Holy crap . $160 4 pasta a burrata; drink? Thats a lot what . It 4 modest pasta/chicken dish a cheese plate . More have . And all the price pretty much kept a secret ahead the meal . Its partly u not asking we noticed the hidden pricing . But we assumed the restaurant would follow the same general pricing for the unofficial menu that it on the official menu; suggested pasta would be about $17 . Turned the pasta parma $26 the burrata wa $27 . Overall the cash aspect and the fact that we felt duped probably stop from returning . Only gave it 3 star because the food wa pretty good . Service wa mediocre.,3.0 star rating

I hesitantly asked waiter if could remade; my surprise; SOOOOO nice offered take it back kitchen . The waiter gave the option ordering something else the menu he would it rushed . I ordered the spaghetti al limone the recommendation some the Yelp review . I enjoy the lemon spaghetti . It creamy fresh; definitely not a bad choice this restaurant; I can't say it's worth trying twice . Overall; In't a terrible experience here; In't think I'll return . You definitely find better (cheaper!) Italian food elsewhere the city . The wait the food quite long too.. I think waited 40+ min the food come; for my lemon pasta it wa brought in le 10 min .

Sadly most disappointing my three visits.Mid week got table outside without reservation; no wait time . One positive.Service indifferent best . As previous reviewer stated half menu price; half . Why not? The waiter seemed extremely bored irritated . A plate rustic bread; focaccia; spicy bean nice touch . The mushroom crostini needed flavor; perhaps touch garlic; parsley; cream . I ordered lemon spaghetti on previous visit absolutely delicious . However time neither creamy tangy enough . Dry.My husband's salmon wa over cooked; nice flavor . Our friend had chicken parmigiana; substantial portion otherwise standard issue.The best dish wa a large platter grilled vegetable .

It's old school basic Italian; sort expect diner another fast food type place . Itn't much flavor it either; a slather cheese watery sauce at least the basil gave the spaghetti a little something.We wanted wine since it's cash didn't want go the atm; skipped drinking.There many many many better and even le expensive Italian joint in nyc .

Theyn't even a waiting area; send incomplete party wait bar next door . Also restaurant be hard miss - In't see sign outside walked right past the first time.The food a good job making for shortcoming though . We ordered the spaghetti al limon the timely priest strangler sausage . Spaghetti al limon - knew a simple dish could taste amazing?? The lemon flavor really stuck; usual sharp lemon way in a well-integrated; aromatic way . It tasted comforting familiar; strangely like lemon poppyseed pound cake in pasta form . I'd never anything like before any Italian restaurant.Timely priest strangler sausage - weird long name...don't let put off . This really delicious . Thick; long tube pasta (something I'd never before) smothered in a generous serving ricotta tomato sauce . Sausage spicy balanced the creamy ricotta wonderfully . Only downside the saltiness.Service mediocre - nothing memorable . Not a fan the tiny space .

3397,32,Came friend's birthday dinner party 14 . They squeezed u long table back room felt cramped . The restaurant East Village I couldn't expect much than being loud; busy; crowded . Their food simple decently priced entree ranging $15- $22 . Our group tried a variety pasta dish including Spaghetti tomato & basil ($ 13.95); Tagliatelle ($ 16.95) special the day . Nothing spectacular the dish - simple hearty Italian food nothing write home . There so many place NYC you want pasta . They allowed u bring a birthday cake the birthday girl without additional fee . The plus- They accept reservation (unlike place East Village) The minus - Theyn't accept credit card . Cash Only . Which made it hard for group 15 people split the bill . I pretty sure boyfriend ended paying $40 than needed; for our group stop arguing the bill and why were short in total . So come prepared.,3.0 star rating

This despite fact I always *think* In't like French food.The restaurant small intimate close seating . Maybe's proper call bistro . Often small restaurant best one ;n't? More attention detail . The service is more personal . This certainly true La Sirene . Everyone encountered friendly; attentive welcoming . Throughout; made sure always everything needed.We started dinner cocktail beet salad apple brie . The salad lovely presentation plate tasted a good . Fresh bright allowing individual flavor come through.And...... the cassoulet . The winter cassoulet...Oh . What I say . A crock full chewy; velvety; rich; meaty goodness . A big bowl heaven . Big enough two share you're light eater like u . All the flavor merged together perfectly . Smooth rich the inside; crispy crunchy around the rim . E pluribus nom nom nom . The combination taste texture transcendent . The staff able recommend a great wine pair this magnificent dish; can a great help . We ended the meal sharing the croquembouche . Three chou ball filled a wonderfully scented pastry cream covered with a light crunchy coating blond caramel.If're ever this neighborhood to see a show; will definitely back.,4.0 star rating

I asked companion try (case I crazy) she confirmed also definitely something burnt . We informed server; he replaced pâté; choice well executed; though memorably exceptional . The Cornish hen very well done; even breast tender moist . They cut into 4 piece make easier diner deal . The stuffing inside also quite tasty; like veggie forward version the traditional Thanksgiving stuff . The accompanying veggie 2 fine; nothing stood . I also really wonder'd solo diner; they stated the menu the veggie were per 2 people . Dessert met expectation; with my croque caramel basically individual portion croquembouche . The caramel shell a bit tacky the custard could used...something; overall wa well executed . What really stole the show me wa the second dessert- the hostess brought out bill wa paid apologized for able bring our original dessert wish my friend a happy birthday . The fact they went beyond in this way wa special; considering we've been slighted some much expensive place . Would I come? Yeah; they mussel; one my favorite dish; I might back try for lunch . Was one dish that I woke this morning craving last night? Sadly; not this round . I also think'd a bit more crowded I'd care experience on night like Friday and Saturday; and a others mentioned; is quite a small space.,4.0 star rating

I got French onion soup; rabbit; banana brulee . The soup alright; I realized I not a fan french onion soup think would enjoyed . The rabbit quite good the portion size; very small . And know not supposed be expected they served with rice the portion rice literally the smallest i have ever in life (think three spoonful). The banana brulee pretty good; kinda banana pudding-y obviously creamy . My friend got the pate an appetizer i think wa a good start the Cornish Hen wa actually quite good a large portion to boot .

Around 5:20pm...Empty..But 6:25pm good amount space already filled people...6:45pm..Almost full house..The atmosphere dim dark; great romantic date . :) And start cooking...The creamy sauce intoxicate air...Even leave restaurant...The menu provided one personable one I've ever pleasure reading; bares soul owner; ha character! :) Makes feel like someone know opened place...He really used first intro page menu lolSampled restaurant week menu...I seated; provided half loaf bread olive oil my order placed.Their ravioli highly recommended! It fantastic!! The portion might seem super small taste beyond's size.The ravioli super tinny; like size piece rectangular gum; surrounded light creamy sauce . And ravioli just kick the mouth it awesome flavor! The dish let's taste the individual flavor how co-mingle; I loved it.The hanger steak cooked garlic; lightly seasoned perfectly paired mingle the four veggie...The flavor the steak light those love salt...You may want add . But'll apparacite the quality the meat; didn't struggle like piece jerky some bite in other restaurants.The dessert a mix the two different cream puff: caramel v dark.chocolate . They nice enough let me mix one each dessert.Cream puff vanilla cream filling; hardened caramel topped powdered sugar...The hardened caramel top a hard candy feel gave a crunch every bite.The dark chocolate one; ice cream filling this pair well the whipped cream mint . However; my favorite...The pastry part this one felt.... I'd recommend the other one.And gave the check a lollypop lol..That's cute hahaha (watermelon flavor) FYI: *Amex cash only wa said soon I walked in . *They actually a wall space next the hostess hang coat . *They check explains the dish rather quickly tell you everything it . So listen carefully ask a repeat lolCon: If you come early they first open; they're prepping the onion the soup; they an open kitchen...Your eye get very sensitive like mine and tear may emerge besides the stinging discomfort.Side note: In't know there's a full moon tonight cause this place so close Chinatown...This place became packed Asians...Like than half the restaurant...Felt abit weird me ...,4.0 star rating

I asked type veggie veggie dish 2 share . He said``In't know; whatever have""really casual way like's job know . He brought bread olive oil . We ask two waiter twice some vinegar . After finish appetizer dish's still . And entree came I half joking him asked``forget something?""He actually replied straight``well; vinegar optional ...""I rolling eye back head try not show temper go eat dinner . Well; asked twice least can come back tell u sorry's vinegar sth . But attitude killing . He probably still want tip; said will bring bread vinegar . Vinegar finally came; forgot bread this time; dinner almost done...And what could happen next; brought wrong dessert . hen't even apologize said he will bring banana brulee; advantage I got free extra dessert I thankful . Again his attitude . Way go! We tried be more understanding since restaurant fully packed; obviously understaffedn't ready restaurant week hype . Well if he wrote our order listen u he took order would helped little . Banana brulee bad btw; uncooked sliced banana starchy pudding...I want get bill get . Before leave I went bathroom; I opened door came; hostess holding lot dish saw I came jump front me all dish slide across my chest . I so afraid . Thank god I made full stopped both hand holding door frame . Otherwise would be a shit show . Shen't apologize think twice what she carried on . The whole experiencen't every good . It made u feel just want our money get u here . The bos need train staff better . Homie casual lay back service style fine . But customer are not bff first encounter . You need to treat manner service standard . Also night across of our table there a fat dude sucking face his girl entire dinner showing explicit PDA; flashing his camera blinding our eye . There were a family table next to u two little girl screaming cry . I to keep rubbing my head relax not to go crazy . I guess we had bad luck and not very tasteful crowd night either . If restaurant understaffed ;n't restaurant week ;'s suicide . Ending note: At least the hanger steak were cooked well; medium rare; tender; were soaked a lot of oil in dish; that bother me a little .

I no idea I going I totally never venture far west SoHo basically no clue I headed . When arrived La Sirene; I checked realized this place incredible review many...yet I'd never heard it . What? The place tiny; dimly lit; smell restaurant; ha intimate seating space . I felt like couple sitting next u basically sitting u I could hear everything saying; though least it different language . Tight seating aside; are able make reservation ahead time so I highly suggest . The noise level so-so...quiet not too loud . It's lovely place nice date . The service also nice - though restaurant packed; were checked quite frequently.Drink wine menu relatively extensive - have nice selection reasonably priced wine.The bread is yum keep refilling you tell them stop . Needless say; lot bread eaten; especially escargot garlic sauce mussel white wine broth.We started order escargot; is best escargot city . I've some pretty crappy French food recent memory I always judge escargot . This passed test . Super fresh flavorful . We also got half order classic white wine/garlic steamed mussel . Also fresh . Remember get extra bread go these.For main; got the duck breast the filet mignon w/foie gras . All their entree come sharable medley vegetable - a carrot mash; chayote; butternut squash; green bean . The entree also came a polenta cake . Both dish were very reasonably priced; to surprise . The duck breast cooked medium flavorful done perfectly . Delicious . However; the star the show evening wa the filet mignon topped with a healthy serving foie gras . Say you about foie...I can't resist . The filet wa perfectly medium rare the added foie gras top basically made my eye roll back . I usuallyn't prefer filet mignon; this one wa so flavorful and nicely seasoned the outside . That foie gras though...For dessert; got the``banana pudding""wa like a banana creme brulee . Nice take on banana pudding...they even put a candle it me! I'm usually skeptical of French cuisine given I've some pretty mediocre French food; La Sirene definitely take the top spot . I be back for that filet/foie combo.",5.0 star rating

3438,33,This place a small gem . The restaurant a small converted hole wall serving best French food I've . To start appetizer all great . We ordered mussel; ravioli; escargot . The escargot a great flavor; buttery delicious . The mussel ordered creole style filled chorizo light cream . My favorite ravioli ha truffle shaved top . The portion is small; the flavor profile is massive . For entree I got the filet foie gras; cooked medium rare . Wow; tender . The combination the fillet; foie gras; sauce a bite heaven . Dessert; Big Profiteroles . I thoroughly surprised how much I enjoyed . Light cream chocolate a pastry? So good . It's AMEX cash; make sure have on hand . It's commendable of the chef accept Amex they the only one help build his credit he wa just starting in America . Will definitely back!,5.0 star rating

3440,33,Personally my favorite French restaurant New York . I usually judge based how escargot; is probably best factor . The escargot very plain bland . We escargot; ravioli; rabbit; the tournedos rossini . The ravioli the filet mignon really good . Ravioli delicious the truffle flavor definitely came . The filet mignon topped foie gras seems overly decadent the flavor amazing . Definitely the entrée get their popular dish a reason . The rabbit unmemorable . This a solid meal with the number amazing French restaurant the city; I just don't think I would returning.,3.0 star rating
3441,33,**Restaurant Week Summer 2017 Review**My sister I made reservation Open Table day were plenty time available . We came 7 Wednesday one their dining room full . And I say full; I mean cramped; were pretty much sitting elbow elbow stranger . Itn't I went go use restroom I discover another dining room; almost empty . I guess did make seem poppin actually was.To start; I Pate de Campagne Maison (served cornichons; dijon; pearl onion). My sister Ravioles de Royan (stuffed comte cheese garlic little tiny ravioli cream truffle). The pate too much some type seasoning - couldn't quite put finger what Waals; pearl onion side salad came definitely helped balance out bit . On other hand; the ravioli amazing . They even whole piece truffle . The portion size would perfect an appetizer anymore; it would been overkill.For the main; I the Steak Tartare Toasted Pugliese Bread; she the Pan-Seared Hangar Steak . I enjoyed steak tartare finished third it; it little much . I think would been better in a smaller portion; an appetizer instead . The hangar steak chewy the flavor excellent; they cooked it in a generous amount fresh garlic.For dessert; I the scoop Cranberry Sorbet . It nice refreshing after a heavy meal like . I able to eat half though it pretty tart . My si the Banana Brûlée (french vanilla custard fresh sliced banana smashed graham cracker); she loved.Not sure I'd back; I'm a fan cramped restaurant I only thought the food wa better okay; and not great . Tip - a glass their house Bordeaux wa $9; wan't bad at all; it quality.,3.0 star rating
3442,33,Intimate spot; plenty table-for-two's; quiet ambiance . They BYOB Sun-Thurs; great option you prefer avoid mark-ups restaurant offer . The menu pretty quintessential staple option try . We went ambitious; heavy appetizer one main course finish . For starter; brought pair; Poires rôties au Bleu Fondant (roasted pear topped crisped Bleu Cheese); accompanied Steak tartare . The pear delectable; balanced . Topped balsamic; bleu cheese all thing ;'d thought; French course; complex formula result something enjoyable! For; big star sea plate come . The steak tartare ;'m experienced; felt solid choice overall . It bit intense onion side thing a large chunk; beef extremely soft mild . A piece toast would been appreciated . Then onto Escargots à la Bourguignonne Seared Foie Gras Balsamic Duck Glaze . No surprise; the escargot point; uniquely served the shell . Honestly; much say ;'ve never a bad order anywhere...butter...garlic...perfect . Foie Gras seared my favorite way . Came 4 sliver a pool Balsamic glaze; for ok . Spread toasted bread; delicious . In't go heavy on the glaze In't think necessary did add much overall . Finally; the main course Carré d'Agneau au jus de truffle; Rack Lamb w/ rosemary truffle . Recommended medium cook came medium-rare anyway...phenomenal . Highly recommended; tender; melty; delicately flavored a I come expect French preparation . Only knock the portion wa quite small; 4 tiny portion...totally craving more! Also just a touch lukewarm; didn't take away the experience . This wa the highlight the night; the Pear; a surprising runner . Finishing with a 6th course wa the Croquembouche au Caramel; puff pastry . The crisp caramel coating really elevated can sometimes a mushy/soggy experience . It wa great; suspect that experience that any choice would have been excellent . I've probably gone long . To wrap up; defn hoping go back try Linguine aux fruit de mer; Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison . As i'm NJ; wanting revisit say a lot considering the endless option the city!,5.0 star rating

3453,33,The thing place that serve REALLY GOOD steak; including filet mignon foie gras truffle slice top - incredibly flavorful deluxe taste . The hanger steak also juicy; fired garlic top also add texture flavor it . Then apparently I would expect French restaurant serve really good quality mussel savory sauce that I could dip bread it . However; musseln't fresh had sand them . The creole sauce just okay . Could pair bread I would expect from Michelin Star place . Regarding seafood linguine; overall flavor too sour did blend the seafood linguine well . Also; ONE scallop the whole dish too much linguine; made doubt whether this place wa trying fill up these linguine . Indeed; I would recommend trying steak/poultry dish; leave the mussel seafood linguine from choice . Amélie (another French place west vill .) better option regarding seafood mussel.,3.0 star rating

The profiterole just terrible; mostly of the added chocolate tasted burnt? unsweetened? Not sure it all I could taste and it bad .

I grilled octopus salad (mushroom tomato) start Seafood Linguini main; per waiter's suggestion . Both good; great . The octopus salad definitely better the linguini . While the seafood actually pretty fresh; the linguini noodle sauce is actually bitter . I remind that I just bother getting seafood outside the Pacific NW; it's surely going disappoint . The service good; given the price; I would be inspired go back.--- update---owner contacted gave run of thought went wrong back the kitchen (new line cook; not enough reduction) offered refund . As someone did master operation; impressed that he diagnosed a production issue took care to make thing right the customer . Textbook operation excellence and customer service!

3473,33,My date I came on Sunday night NYC restaurant week . We thought would packed when arrived table available . My biggest fear being cramped between couple luckily placed intimate two seater . When were given menu; our waiter briefly explained menu...attitude seemed nonchalant . He barely smiled questioned friend's choice wine . It very putting . Aside our waiter; I ordered French onion soup; braised rabbit; banana brulee . My friend ordered pate; salmon; profiterole . My French onion soup amazing! Delicious . The braised rabbit lacking something; I know rabbitn't very meaty animaln't much flavor palate . It drizzled a heavy mushroom sauce didn't much compliment the rabbit . The banana brulee okay; I always prefer brulee warm custard instead super cold . There a graham cracker bottom surprising since traditionally isn't really made like . My friend liked pate; I didn't really . It too grainy; it reminded me meatloaf . His salmon delicious! Amazingly crunchy crust paired a great mustard sauce . His profiterole were good yet; nothing special . The dish came a side dish of carrot pure; cauliflower; sweet potato . Delicious! Overall; my experience wa so/so . There were some thing I liked disliked . It reminded me of French comfort food . Would I come back? Probably.,3.0 star rating
3474,33,Worth splurge . Ravioli must try . They're generous foie gras black truffle . Great service .

3494,33,La Sirene delicious a it Yelp star rating impressive! French food often inflated bougey New York City . It's hard eat on anything than white tablecloth dimly lit restaurant . But La Sirene different . Its modest interior charmingly conversational menu--opinion; refreshing . The escargot good--might well from; still manages be delicious comparable escargot I've in France . So much be said restaurant it bread--refill three time . Needless say; fresh bread . We order torissimo; signature dish--disk pate atop a steak au jus . SO FRENCH--delightful . I would recommend anyone is a fan pate . I not; I wouldn't say it converted; I can see appeal this dish . I had seafood linguine; in my opinion--better dish . seafood VERY fresh; the pasta delicious.For dessert; had the banana pudding brûlée; wa light delicious! Though the menu isn't the CHEAPEST meal around; it attests the quality the food; not for bougey flare . If're contesting La Sirene Tourneau; I'd definitely go for La Sirene!,5.0 star rating

I felt the polenta cake neither added nor detracted it.I got the kassulet compare with the vegan one I at Le Village--I prefer the meat-free version . Might have liked more more veggie texture . However the juices/drippings are incredible! Sip dip when it's still hot it's the flavor the casserole concentrated in a perfect mouthful . I would gladly order purely broth were an option!

It hold the cheese sauce well and maintains a great crunch . My one critique the classic pizza that is a touch salty . I trying figure if that wa the cheese the sauce . Overall; I would definitely recommend you come . The food wa great even though I wouldn't put the pizza top 5 I would put it in my Top 10 . Solid lunch spot if you need a place go around the area.,5.0 star rating
3552,34,There's reason usually book weekend reservation month advance . Rubirosa some best tasting pizza I've ever . If're thinking coming; first piece advice start looking reservation now.I came recently family my fiancée's family everyone agreed food fantastic . As whole; huge eater; seven u; ordered 2 large pizza pie; large pasta; an appetizer . It perfect amount us.We roasted octopus appetizer; look like regular seafood dish; octopus extremely soft tender; caught off guard delicious . The pizza ordered full large pie Rubirosa Supreme (my personal favorite great meat lover); half large pie Tie-Dye terrifically sweet; half a large pie Sausage & Broccoli Rabe (a red sauce pizza; also great). Each the pizza a distinctly different taste great share among seven people . Another tip is that can ask server cut the pizza 16 piece; it's easier large party to try the piece want.The last thing ordered the Black & White Tagliatelle . All the parent loved the seafood tagliatelle this dish; it certainlyn't lacking seafood . The sauce noodle also a nice seafood flavor; the tagliatelle part my personal favorite . The final price for food tax tip wa about $20 per person; is affordable compared to other Italian restaurant NYC (although pizza are typically cheaper pasta). I've come twice; each time I've left happy feeling the great experience wa worth the affordable price . I would order everything I again; probably next time I come with a large party.,5.0 star rating

3600,34,This might best NYC offer; For it up like Roberta's; John's Bleecker; Prince St. Pizza; Bleecker St. Pizza; etc.I got 1/2 tie-dye 1/2 vodka to-go since place slammed.The crust perfect; Soft chewy throughout pie moving progressively toward perfectly light; crispy exterior . There also char mark spotted throughout underside; always good sign my book.The sauce extremely flavorful; vodka coming brighter; sweeter; generally better the red sauce the tie-dye (though I thought were the same sauce?) the pesto the tie-dye rich; garlic-y; herbaceous.The cheese also good - compete small; slightly blistered spot - though nothing terribly special . I also wish (this is true with many place )'d just slightly cheese coverage (maybe 75% the pie instead of; say 50-60 %). That said; can order extra mozz just few dollar; not really much complain long a you know going it that you might want to do that.Overall; possibly the very best pizza I've ever.,5.0 star rating

The crust on the pizza unique . It's thin; crisp; almost cracker like; still the right thickness still create a balance chew crunch . This crust just a supporting role the fresh ingredient delicious pizza sauce though . Everything worked really well together tasted amazing . I honestly wouldn't wait more than an hour I came back; it's definitely rave worthy; say a lot NY there's amazing pizza around every corner.,4.0 star rating
3606,34,"Let start by saying I've visited Rubirosa past two weekend . It so happens aligned perfectly yearly San Gennaro Festival . So naturally; Nolita Little Italy entrenched constant flood people.Having read Rubirosa it reputation one city's best pie; I cross place list . I high expectation we approached restaurant front; made sure temper somewhat I've let before (I'm calling; Keste!).The pizza thin crust; quite paper thin ;'s definitely closer Lombardi's John's Bleecker . Having said; I always preferred latter term consistency mouth feel . This bit context important; put perspective incredible pizza is.We ordered small pie - one half Tie-Dye; other Funghi . The Funghi white pizza mozzarella; oyster mushroom; roasted garlic; topped Arugula . The garlic paired mushroom really gave nice earthy bite; arugula helped balance out oiliness slice . Definitely one better white slice I've recent memory; deserving four star rating it . But real main event Tie-Dye slice . Perhaps most Instagram-worthy the variety served by Rubirosa; this one feature standard tomato vodka sauce; along fresh mozzarella a light striping pesto . The latter ingredient night seem like much; the kick the pesto beautifully contrasted the creaminess the vodka blended perfectly the chewy mozzarella bite . The acidity the tomato sauce brought home all the topping element . That's where the experience end; however . The dough this slice is perfectly crisp the bottom; just the right amount brick oven char (though admittedly In't know they use method). The crust element crispiness; a nice doughy softness inside . The contrast flavor texture a bit surprising a pie that wa``the top""one would assume breaking the topping list.To conclude; might around the corner Lombardi's; a place that is adorned a reputation a one the area's finest thin crust institution (it wa good; not great); Rubirosa crafted a place itself among the upper echelon of NYC pizza lore . It might well the standard bearer thin crust in all of the five borough . That said; are plenty of others to try.It's a slam dunk 5/5 this place . I definitely back .``That's review; Frankie . ''",5.0 star rating

3662,34,BEST PIZZA IN THE WORLD HANDS DOWN.Came on recommendation Strictly Dumpling I'm SO glad did . Writing review I'm restaurant seriously I can't wait everyone try place . MUST TRY: half tie dye; half supreme . The supreme little meat heavy me male friend LOVED . It truly a meat lover's paradise . I personally really enjoyed tie dye; the pesto on point . The crust these pizza so thin unlike anything I've ever tried . I nothing good thing say Rubirosa pizza! A large pizza perfect 3 people; were full the end not stuffed . The service wa good the vibe great . This definitely a gem lower Manhattan I can't wait come back! Of the food I ate NY; wa probably my favourite spot . Oh don't afraid the hour wait; go quicker you think.,5.0 star rating
3663,34,OKAY FINE . Despite particularly unpleasant experience wine bottle mixup bar; food phenomenal I'm still rating 4 star . Like; let's put way - miserably cold rainy Sunday my friend I inexplicably atrocious mood left this place feeling like whole new human thanks how amazing food . I've trying come while; wait's always somewhere ballpark 2-3 hour I've never able plan far enough ahead I kill much time area waiting table . It Sunday Halloween city pretty dead Sunday night; decided'd take stab one time . Sure enough; wait totally reasonable - maybe around 45 minute; decided stick out.They asked u willing take bar seatn't problem we able seated sooner . The bartender friendly helpful recommendation - suggested we split the calamari start we SO glad we did - the portion size huge breaded/fried perfectly - crispy yet light; delicious lemon; served an amazing marinara; we given plenty yet still finished . We ordered half half large around $28 I believe . We got half the Supreme (believe thats - basically a bunch meat) the tie-dye (pesto vodka). The pizza fairly thin wan't crispy/burnt - half delicious although I think I liked the tie-dye slightly . It's also nice that you opt pick two different choice everything the menu sounded great so it would been tough pick just one! We were stuffed we finished eating although the pizza wan't filling I wa expecting - two girl split a large without bursting afterwards.Now the one negative: we ordered a different bottle wine the one we were given; wa a higher price point . This happened and apparently relatively common practice restaurant; which bother me I feel like least some case it's done intentionally . I guess I'll give Rubirosa the benefit the doubt in this case; I'll for sure be careful to check label intently I return . TL; DR: phenomenal phenomenal food . Plan ahead your wait book a table because otherwise it's usually brutal; worth it!,4.0 star rating

Their meat thinnnnnnnnly sliced; folded that you pick up; open more meat that you thought would!

First sip broth you go wow!!! Your tongue instantly get coated thick brothy umami you immediately reach another spoonful . The topping point.. Menma nice crunchy; scallion fresh; egg golden inside; clam cooked right . I loved pork gf's tonkotsu; it too meaty (the recently converted vegetarian) her.I'd nitpick one thing . Both ramens heavy flavor; and especially the smoked dashi ramen need variation to balance thing and give the taste bud a bit rest . It get very tiresome on the palate you keep on having the ramens .

After ordering one regular one mini ramen; the minin't much smaller the regular size! We also ordered extra noodle it very unnecessary the soup ton noodle it the way it . The mini wa perfect a meal; the regular one would probably (least me) last two meal so . The broth wa not salty all; went well the egg; the pork the scallion .

Prices range 14 buck bowl about 20 combo . Seating either bar table the decor nice modern . Service also decent . Food they could've done better.The food OK just little thing make the dining experience . I got a lunch salad while the veggie fresh; the dressing so sour that inedible . It literally like sucking a lemon . Ramen came it slightly better . Noodles a bit overcooked the broth really good (smoked dashi rich flavorful; spicy tan tan actually spicy). My issue that there always something . Their marinated bamboo shoot cut about a quarter inch thick - way thick absorb the marinade and tough chew . Charsiu cut thin the piece wa super wide - sort like 1980's slice of pimento loaf .

There so many great ramen spot NY; plenty serve high-priced; high-quality bowl--Menkoi; Wanpaku (experimental); Ippudo--go them . This a classic example a good restaurant got the review it wanted then stopped trying.,2.0 star rating

3711,35,My new favorite ramen place! Delicious tonkotsu broth; super friendly service; amazing dessert . It's popular place be sure check waitlist Yelp plan accordingly make reservations.First sip Classic Tonkotsu broth it hit right spot my tongue . Salty; fatty; savory ton umami flavor . Their chashu deceptively lean without noticeable ring fat it melted my mouth . Even thick bamboo shoot tender thick noodle nice chew it . The price tag bowl ($ 16) hurt a little I very satisfied I finished . We also tried spicy wing while I've crunchier one; super juicy; amazing flavor a little kick . Everything tasted great we ended ordering Matcha Kakigori dessert well . The honey cream red bean top added much a dessert that I usuallyn't care . On top that; their matcha LEGIT . And finally; the happy-hour priced drink were solid (I preferred my friend's lemon sour my Tokyo highball).We great service our waiter the ambiance very lively . I'm excited come back!,5.0 star rating
3712,35,A little pricey a work lunch service quick ramen delicious!! The pork much leaner I used tender flavorful . The broth creamy luscious a good ramen broth .

Not a big deal since still good; something lacking.So ramen delicious; the bun were very so-so what we paid got . The bun were delicious; the rest it pretty forgettable .

3728,35,Tonchin ramen want boujee bowl ramen . The price topping over top; maybe unnecessary; still good hidden behind unassuming door.One bowl; one visit; enough me . The lunch set great . I got spicy tan tan $18 an unagi rice ball $4; rice brick be honest . The lunch set save a dollar two rice brick.Spicy tan tan rich; flavorful; large . The pork tender; meaty; get two slice . The half egg good . But green salad mix; onion; peanut top? Egg noodle; al dente ;n't heavy eggy taste . The unagi rice ball topped sansyo pepper; ie soft light peppercorn; I personally reallyn't like . I see people like it the freshness pop flavor.The music playing did not fit the lunch time mood . Underground; grunge beat a brightly lit modern restaurant . Service good; quiet; efficient . Sometimes ramen best a simple bowl sometimes you want it fancy . That's when you go Tonchin for a bowl ramen.,4.0 star rating
3729,35,Came dinner 2 weekday night added onto waitlist 14 yelp.. 1.5 hr wait point I explored around Bryant park area there 2-3 party ahead it 15 min wait . Moral story: add waitlist yelp won't add over phone!! From seated ordering getting food ordering dessert getting check efficient wonderful!! I believe le an hr all! Ok thing actually matter: classic tonkotsu friend's spicy tan tan noodle (n't spicy I'll prob get next time some extra kick!). We loved noodle; I thought broth a tad salty drink it's; noodle just right consistency thickness texture! I one happy camper . For $17 sure seem put amount noodle pork there!! The meat wa flavored just right texture perfect (dry; too chewy.. I'm pretty easy please (:). Friend decided get dessert recommender raved; I ended even finishing my noodle leave room for dessert . Sad decision a good one the matcha shaved ice wa a perfect way balance the heavy ramen dinner . Though I wish'd put syrup the whipped cream the middle there's a surprise the middle chunkn't left bland and..icy.. preferable whipped cream (that's heavier your typical whipped cream oh heavenly)!! Had I known the portion size I would've gone w the smaller size ($ 4 le half the amount.. not really a deal..) be perfectly content w finishing the noodle AND dessert! Def want to come back to try item the menu!!,4.0 star rating
3730,35,Tonchin solid ramen joint definitely one better one city! I suggest reserving table party bigger 3 putting your name on waitlist beforehand; there always seems be more 30 min wait .

My friend ordered classic tonkatsu ramen I ordered smoked dashi ramen . I really enjoyed smoked dashi ramen; I wouldn't recommend if don't enjoy fishy thing . The broth flavorful rich ;n't heavy point made feel lethargic disgusting . It came 4 clam; very plump bamboo shoot a soft boiled egg; which cooked perfectly! My friend really enjoyed the tonkatsu ramen . The broth also rich; not heavy . I really enjoyed the ramen because it's one the place don't overdo it the sodium . There a perfect amount of saltiness; didn't make grab water every bite . The noodle thick chewy I absolutely problem with it Service wa terrific!

It decently sized; it bit pricey what it . It's bad I would come just the shaved ice . Going back the ramen; the broth isn't salty you won't need drown water afterwards . I asked my noodle be cooked longer since I prefer soft noodle definitely you want noodle be softer . The egg delicious made perfectly runny . The pork is like a slice ham it wa just okay me . Still good though.Overall; glad see're well still in business . Wen't many good ramen place around the Herald Square area that is authentic this is welcome.,4.0 star rating

For appetizer: -chashu rice ball - tonchin chicken bunOur waiter fly never really took time hear we saying ask u we allergy . We; peanut . We finally got ramen 15-20 minute we completed appetizer thoroughly disappointing . As soon they sat tan tan ramen front u; could smell peanut just looking; thick . We asked waiter change it because allergy he stomped bowl if we offended . He hadn't even taken time check on u than entire visit . I ordered the Tonchin Classic Tokyo it underwhelming . The noodle nothing write home about the brothn't even worth two bite . It wa missing any sort depth least 5 hour cooking . The lackluster service coupled with our server even caring to ask about allergy knowing fully they serve peanut their food reason enough to warrant 0 star; I'm sure's worse ramen somewhere else the world 2 star suffice . We've eaten at a large majority the ramen spot in NYC LA and this wa the disappointing all . Will be back .

I tried the shishito pepper unagi; theyn't notable.DRINKS: They a happy hour includes $7 sake wine! There's also cool cocktail . I tried the smoke matcha cocktail (vodka; matcha; matcha ice cream) the presentation fun tasted delicious (what won't taste good matcha ice cream?!) SPACE: Tonchin more trendy-like than classic Japanese ramen shop-like...actually make it a great spot catch with friend for a date! Typical ramen shopn't enough seating they're too crowded - not Tonchin .

3753,35,"I wanted give Tonchin benefit doubt considering many elite Yelpers raving spot . The girl I craving noodle near area . However last night's service In't think I give star . Came girl around 630-645 pm . Boy rude awakening.CONS: Doing something different my usual review going straight went wrong - The host incredibly rude u . My girl make call outside; I decided go restaurant ask wait time . The host like``we can't get seated your entire party seated .""I like see make call . Very unprofessional . Fine; whatever . I decided ask long we expect wait two top - then insisted our party must together; blatantly ignoring we're all restaurant . I like``can't give straight answer how long wait??? I'm asking be seated right; I just want time how long wait going be're telling I'm going go somewhere else .""Incredibly frustrating since I just asking time how long wait we expect be . It took u 15 minute back forth we got seated . Fine; whatever; maybe ramen blow u away . We dead wrong.Dashi Ramen - This what I got . So ramen market having dashi flavor minimal dashi flavor all . Heck; I find instant ramen/udon noodle have much balanced dashi flavor . The Tonkotsu pork bone broth also smother whatever dashi; ended tasting like Tonkotsu bowl . There also surprisingly chasu (pork belly slice) this bowl . Very disappointing! I've been least 20+ ramen restaurant joint NYC ramen thats $15 dollar plus I never encountered bowl doe have pork belly slice it!!! Fine; have three clam it maybe's it drove price; clam came dead cold grainy; immediately tell the chef properly clean the seafood . Also this bowl very expensive ($ 17 if I recall correctly; correct if I wrong); I can get Tonkotsu $12 pack a lot flavor it . Texture also with the black garlic oil (assume what it?). No garlic aromaticity it all . Tan Tan Ramen - That's what she got . Was pretty spicey - that wa the main flavor I got . Broth wasnt developed fully enough it tasted really thin imo . At least she got some chasu prok her ramen I believe wa a dollar cheaper . Service wa also pretty terrible . Took forever get u to pay the bill to flag them down . Waiters host need to pay attention.MISC: Decor nice . Its chic modern . OVERALL: Do not recommend . If want a good tonkotsu; check Totto; Hide-chan; Mu for a good tonkotsu . I've heard Momosan make a good Tan tan ramen well although I havent had a great experience yet . Jun-men's black garlic tokotsu also a hella flavorful than what I got . This ramen restaurant is wayyyy expensive for what you're getting please avoid at all cost.",1.0 star rating

I feel like doen't add anything really unique NY ramen scene.I started meal the chicken wing . I applaud the team creating wonderful mixture spice ;n't really I expecting . More Asian vs. North American wing; fault Tonchin; something aware of.In regard the ramen; I got the tonkotsu (given seems be the most popular choice). The broth very good rich (although bit salty) the meat good . The noodle pretty average doen't really outperform underperform vs. restaurant .

It's mix maguro tuna; diced veggie; avocado; spicy mayo; etc . then give lettuce & nori do like DIY wrap . It's $23; although I could easily finish this own appetizer; I'm poor that.Half u got spicy tan tan ramen half u got Tonchin classic tonkotsu ramen . I liked roasted pork meaty not fatty pork belly like most ramen place . The portion also generous.They the same tonkotsu broth base at first I found really rich yum . Then quickly became kind heavy I grew kind sick . It probably would have helped have something else eat it on the side would kind cleanse palate; because a lot the stuff pretty pricy; In't want order food--especially I wouldn't be able to finish ramen it was.So half my group agreed me 3 u couldn't finish our ramen .

The wing juicy tender; I'm sure this intentional not; partially deboned they super easy eat . The white pink pepper added nice heat depth flavor an otherwise standard appetizer . The chicken tsukune likens a chicken pork meatball nestled a bun; delicious the teriyaki sauce.I got the classic tonkotsu ramen outstanding . The broth rich not salty . The noodle firm springy . The pork slice (although wide folded blanket-style) tender . No flashy ingredient each wa tuned perfectly . For dessert; I highly recommend getting the matcha milk shaved ice .

3827,36,"First; honesty; I torn btwn 4 5 star - yelp; give u option half!! None le; toyed rating 4 instead 5...thought; knew choosing go eat; i cant complain significantly take entire one main gripe i; wasnt pricey little much . For example; friend got cocktail despite being $14 piece . They well-made drink In't know; I think $14 little bit excessive . The party I ready leave eating dinner/entrees; tummy full opting dessert!! Boohoo - I not get try creme brulee although I huge creme brulee fan lover.. yet; I also noticed price shocking $14 . I scarcely see dessert such hefty price tag attached it.The customer service five star without doubt . The following example what; opinion; show top-notch service restaurant...entree I ordered salmon came over delicious fluffy cloud mashed potato asparagus . On menu dish described mentioned came mustard sauce I saw would fine I no problem mustard . Yet; salmon came; otherwise A+ (fish); mustard sounded menu like going like marinade slim topping . I very dissappointed upset I saw dish come mustard piece massively dominating plate.... It white consistency something like sour cream . I could barely even try I very very much believe mayonnaise one ingredient probably meant a sort innovative take tartar sauce than a mustard . It unfortunate; mayonnaise top 5 hated despised ingredient . What I love impressed - I not ask server anything dish ordering case; I not type person is going complain something I fault.... Yet; superman/manager/owner swooped right; saved dish!! Keep mind; wa upon observation I not said anything original distaste dish alleged mustard sauce . In mind; I count with finger I recollect a worker intercepting obvious sign distaste and/or dissatisfaction.. without saying a peep!! In't recall dish wa probably $35 even though wa my mistake because I not asked dish I ordered - guy smoothly both politely pleasantly arrives my side asks dish because apparently saw trying scrape the sauce (wa a lot). He immediately asked I wanted a new piece salmon wa a very generous offer I accepted again; I felt wa my own responsibility not asking ordering . Although; said worker asked about another option; I told the fish wa fine I not want/need replaced (duh; bc I felt bad). He offered the option keeping all the item the dish replating all the large amount mustard sauce scrapingn't dominating my plate . I did take up would not thought option my own.. completely changed the dish; my overall experience . Majorly - my personal taste; went near inedible very tasty high quality.My friend ordered seafood Paella wa about $51 not knowing; a dish best for 2 share; my opinion . The portion wa so large considering the rice le substantial item; made sense the dish wa large for the mere fact the way it waz done; would be getting a decent amount seafood opposed skimping . I not imagine one person finishing that dish.When it come decor; In't know that I the proper verbiage 2 explain the style this establishment I'll give it a try...arriving on the early side; 7 p.m.; there still a few table available . When first open the door outside; pas what I think might be a velvet like curtain . Then; the left will find the bar . For lack better word; it did a``classy""feel it if I were in better financial standing; I may have returned I'm just on tight of a budget personally.Thank you so much the gentleman appeared; of his own accord; ultimately saved my dish replating it!!!!! I wa very taken aback that and not just because it made the dish much desirable but it went show that they offer top-notch service and that is somewhat hard find; least it above-and-beyond like that.",5.0 star rating

3848,36,I pleasantly surprised late night eatery . Blue Ribbon wrong! I tried few dish; even I don't typically eat I absolutely amazed how delicious flavorful everything no le three' clock morning . The chef paid much attention care each dish; only dish cooking evening . For appetizer selected soft shell crab beef marrow oxtail marmalade . I've never tried beforen't sure expect . The marrow served bone along bread . The marrow melt mouth like butter oxtail marmalade added touch sweetness . The soft shell crab seasoned well leg claw crunchy meat inside really juicy . They season right crab fresh really clean . I detected salt; pepper; hint garlic . No additional seasoning necessary; perfect . For main course I ordered red trout bacon green bean almond . The bacon cooked top filleted trout skin; yet saltiness bacon somehow penetrated skin fish saltiness bit fat fish delectable . The green bean more firm side I loved . No one like soggy green bean . The almond gave nice crunch . The presentation seemed a little bit over place however plate photograph well tasty . It come a starch side pretty filling own . The fish very tender.My lovely friend invited along introduced place chose Paella Basquez came a medley vegetable tossed yellow rice spicy chicken sausage a great array seafood compliment including clam; mussel; shrimp octopus . The sausage really spicy I detected sage well . It taste unlike chicken sausage I've past . I wouldn't surprised if sausage made in house . The shrimp perfectly cooked octopus slightly chewy's pretty typical . The portion size large; enough two people share sure's a big eater I able sample some this fine dish . My friend ordered the Pigeon toasted barley; sweet potato; apple . I reluctantly tried the pigeon be rude's something I would usually order . In honestyn't bad . It reminded the taste duck . The portion meat the small side pigeon not very meaty the side came complimented well . The sweet potato sweet without going overboard a light dash cinnamon . Sort like the sweet potato served Thanksgiving dinner . I'm not a huge fan barley either even good . Before closed the tab shared a creme brulee a we all way full a whole desert ourselves . It wa by far the creamiest creme brulee I've in forever . I recently some creme brulee another brasserie not very long ago the one at Blue Ribbon completely blew it the water; landed it; smothered it to death . Yes it wa serious . The crunchy torched mocha shell top wa ever so thin whoever made it definitely knew doing; knew the exact amount sugar to put on top . The other one I at the other restaurant wa good it came a layer sugar so thick could went ice skating on it . It felt like I wa eating pop rock instead of creme brulee . I've completely changed mind the fact that can't get quality food in the city past 2am . Where this place all life?!?!?! Aside the quality of food the employee are beyond attentive . Every time you step away the table re-fold your napkin . They are very accommodating they knew the menu inside out . Wen't have to ask the dessert menu because the waiter knew exactly they had to offer . Everyone wa very polite; our server; to the bartender; all the waiter . While drink list not incredibly extensive they did pick the best selection the could choose . I had the chardonnay a tried dark IPA they were both great . I can't wait to return!,5.0 star rating

The perrogis steamed horrible mistake; despite recommendation server . They limp cooked enough . Wouldn't mattered the quite fresh cheese overwhelmed the taste making the unappetizing texture secondary concern . The sea bass special first bite great; everything expect sea bass .

The burger wa good; nothing compared the fried chicken; is you go BRB anyway; right? You may balk the $28.50 price tag; you literally get half a chicken ;'s a ton food . I'm embarrassed admit; I couldn't finish despite delicious it wa . The collard and mashed potato the side were also a great complement.Surprisingly; the meal ended being relatively affordable .

That In't make reservation evening; I guess I considered lucky gotten table all solitary diner . I passed this chic-looking South Village place previous New York trip saw serve 4AM . Now reason I entertaining midnight dinner I took two Broadway show row day feeble attempt pack much New York I could single weekend . I tray mini-donuts Glazed & Confused kiosk Times Square street fair tie over.I seated tight fit table banquette apparently Real Housewives Whatevah holding court their whipped husband . I felt self-conscious because minute I sat between; bleached blonde one right me asked moved another table . She tried whisper server fake fingernail-encrusted hand; I could have heard her Joisey dyin'-cat screech a mile away . It quite dark; I managed get menu close enough table candle make word . Although seafood a dominant part their offering; I drawn to carnivorous options.I started first a $14 Sullivan Street Spritz; sounded like a cocktail a New Jersey housewife would order . It a refreshing mix Kronan Swedish Punsch; Hayman Old Tom Gin; Lemon juice Avanyo Cava ice (photo: bit.ly/1OO19ED). Itn't last long . At same time; I handed a cutting board fresh bread a bit overwhelming hour even the creamy butter the side (photo: bit.ly/1hML6tz). For my appetizer; I ordered the $19 Beef Marrow Oxtail Marmalade genuinely spectacular three generous-sized bone filled decadently grisly marrow surrounded the hearty marmalade sweetened sauteed onion (photo: bit.ly/1NPynF4).There an abundance grilled toast wedge perfectly matched the amount marrow marmalade that could be spread . No accident I'm sure . I had the audacity following this the $32 Hanger Steak; perfectly medium rare sectioned three part that cut like butter . It wa accompanied sauteed wild mushroom topped quite a pile light onion ring most easily devoured (photo: bit.ly/1W1zh5N). By 1:30AM; the restaurant wa still full late-night diner; the housewife were such a yakety-yak high frequency that I'm sure the neighborhood dog could hear them .

We seated promptly a small table pretty close adjacent table (would my one complaint ;'s 's a really tight space) relatively small; dimly lit restaurant.There some appetizer entree special the evening; we went item the normal menu--the bone marrow appetizer oxtail marmalade the fried chicken x2 . There also a whole loaf bread the table we had to cut . The whole loaf nice theory actually pretty difficult / messy to cut; I almost would preferred fresh bread already sliced . The bone marrow absolutely delicious...came 6 piece toast; 3 piece bone bone marrow inside; on a bed delicious oxtail marmalade . It incredibly flavorful rich; I wanted!! BRB's signature dish the fried chicken; my friend I opted . A leg; thigh; drumstick; wing came a bed creamy mashed potato collard green . There also interesting honey came the fried chicken vaguely reminded of cough syrup...I wish there normal honey I would preferred . I felt that our chicken a little dry; the skinn't fried well I expected it to . It still tasty sure; not quite the amazing fried chicken experience I wa expecting!,3.0 star rating
3876,36,Not impressed . Had high expectation the food incredibly ordinary . The steak tartar boring the worst I had a long time . Oysters the best part . The fish salted a bit over cooked.The fried chicken looked great we not the mood.Lots better choice . I stick blue ribbon sushi.,3.0 star rating

I felt incredibly decadent! Fois gras; bone marrow; escargot? Sweetbreads; pigeon; duck breast? And oh; that rack lamb I see? After much pondering; I finally decided the duck breast . We also ordered bone marrow oxtail marmalade start; bone marrow the menu; I order (even if the dish try sway). The bone marrow the best-prepared any I've . The bone cleaned cut that can literally push all the marrow; instead having spoon out! The sweet savory marmalade a nice accompaniment; although I find a touch strong . The duck breast ridiculously good . It cooked perfectly; slightly crisp the outside; tender pink on the inside the orange sauce a nice tang . The turnip puree; sprout; beet went well the meat . I also tried the sweet spicy catfish; tasty my dish wa so much better . We ended the strawberry sundae; wa huge! Great place; be prepared drop a lot $$ $.,4.0 star rating

3879,36,Omg; fried chicken!! Was area craving fried chicken Yelp (yet) steered direction place . At first glance I got confused Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken East Village--needle say ;'re related . Came Saturday 6pm . Luckily crowdedn't rolled yet able get table 2 without wait reservation . Huge selection menu! Because I recently tied strict budget we opted split appetizer main dish; turned more enough (translation: decent portion size!). Plus; complimentary bread loaf huge (score!). We ordered Pierogis (fried; also get boiled) start then famous Fried Chicken plate; came 4 huge piece; collared green mashed potato! I'm salivating memory! Crunchy the outside; dusted their special seasoning add much flavor; tender the inside! And the green mash perfect accompaniment . The place pretty small about dozen so table (party 2 6-7; though I'm sure can rearrange bigger party) plus a handful seat at the bar . It's dimly light pretty quiet; so perfect a special date night celebrating friends.Service great - server Brendon very nice attentive . Sometimes more upscale place like it's easy get the stuffy waiter make feel like can't afford to eat - luckily wan't the case! Bottomline: If love fried chicken this place is a must-try! A little pricey worth it . Consider a special occasion if you're in the mood to splurge a bit!,4.0 star rating

The meal definitelyn't``bad""it left lasting memory except my wallet.Our party 4 arrived 5pm Sunday place empty except 4-5 people bar 2 occupied table . The spot nice; definitely far cry bustling; vibrant setting of other review mentioned (seems like late night atmosphere different). Our waiter fine maybe a bit young/inexperienced.We started Steamed Clams tender a buttery broth . Sadly; highlight . Our main Founder; Shrimp Provencal; Paella Basquez; Roast Chicken . The Shrimp easily the best entree excellent flavor ravioli . The Flounder good; the Paella Chicken were both mediocre . The Paellan't much depth beyond spicy chicken sausage; the roast chicken; cooked perfectly very moist; almost flavor . Even the``amazing""sauce I been promised fell flat . On the plus side; the cocktail were good; a bit pricey.Bottom line: It overpriced overhyped . I probably wouldn't recommend place come back myself . Its not often I feel tricked leaving establishment; Blue Ribbon definitely made feel like I paying $$ $$ $food .

Needless say; I absolutely starving time sat eat . We ordered bone marrow start; fried chicken lamb our main; course accompanied bottle wine . The bone marrow delicious a reviewer promise . They gave u generous portion stew accompanied hearty flavorful . I loved fried chicken . It perfectly fried; crispy delicious . I doused it liberal amount honey literally licking my finger . The bad thing I report that chicken breast piece rather dry . Otherwise; the dark meat piece juicy; delicious; tender . In't like the lamb it slightly the gamey side; James loved it . Thankfully me; didn't like the chicken that much (primarily itn't smothered gravy) I left the task of devouring the entire chicken (I proceeded to do happily). The service wa really superb .

They small I say *must try* like piergoi's . + DUCK BREAST turnip puree; brussel sprout beet & orange sauce . Now're getting the good stuff . I asked medium duck cooked absoluuuutely poul-fectly; easily the *best duck breast* I've had . It perfectly seasoned the side brussel sprout (they had little balasamic them) made just the perfect combo . *MUST TRY*Have add I; full point (also two glass wine deep; had the malbec; the cabarnet blend) + FRIED CHICKEN mashed potato collared green . This what boyfriend got apprently is *the thing order* you come I must say; is dubbed reason . The biggest appeal behind chicken is the thin; crispy skin along the very juicy meat . The green cooked seasoned perfectly the mashed potato very buttery well . Also; they give you side honey gravy your chicken (amazing; a choice savory/sweet)... apparently the *honey is homegrown* the owner a farm?! Very cool . But wa amazing would *MUST TRY . * Might even go far say is the best fried chicken I tried the city far ;) + CHOCOLATE BRUNO; a flourless; very dense chocolate cake ha fudge come chocolate & vanilla ice cream . Now it time dessert; barely made . Now you're a huge fan chocolate; is the one you . I; honest; not a huge fan chocolate cake ice cream; so In't appreciate this decadent dessert much boyfriend; still very delicious nonetheless . Might try the creme brulee next time around . + IRISH COFFEE with homemade whipped cream . My night cap the final blow appetite . I might well have been rolled the restaurant lol . But very delicious; very hot; very strong and a compliment the chocolate cake . Love the homemade whipped cream . All all...The portion were verrrry generous and I wa content the end my meal . Also; I wa full say the least :) But I definitely be going back!! Have my eye the paella next time . Its the pricier side; definitely worth it in my opinion; a lot of *MUST TRY's* . Would 1000% recommend . Also; looking forward to trying more blue ribbon restaurant! Yay for trying this gem.,5.0 star rating

The biscuit jam pretty good (I'm sad say I enjoyed more their pancake) I tried my mom my see maybe In't fan blueberry one; weird flavor...taste bitter . I thought lot afterward the conclusion I came MAYBE the syrup.. how two different pancake order the same bitter taste.. the only thing they common wa they both had the syrup top.. since In't taste without it.. maybe's it wa!! Maybe bad batch? .. In't know! But it wa really disappointing since I wa so excited!!: (I won't rule out completely.. such high rating so many review to mean something!! So I would like to give them second try hope I can bump my rating to a 5 I really hate giving low ratings.. at the same time.. I felt I had to honest .

3938,37,I went pancake month February (they a different pancake flavor everyday) a weekday morning crowded cash . Luckily are 2 ATMs close . My experience going very subpar pancake good I'm trying rate based food . The pancake flavor day blueberry yuzu; seemed like regular blueberry pancake the menu plus extra topping . It $19 steep a cash place pancake . The pancake absolutely amazing though I would definitely want try again . We also ordered the Spanish scramble; ok . It probably would've tasted better Cholulan't flag a server they seemed impatient . The coffee watered the Bloody Mary ($ 13) extremely weak we couldn't really taste the alcohol . I would recommend going for pancake everything else wa not really worth . Portions huge though between two girl; we leftover . I realize I went pancake month it wa pretty busy for a weekday morning . The waitress seemed extremely impatient u we asked question and the food took 30+ minute come . The bottomless coffee wa filled very often though wa good . Wen't think order pancake would $19 especially since it wa cash and therefore had go to the ATM twice.,4.0 star rating

That said; friend yesterday liked it . I thought it wa okay; I would bring anyone back fried chicken waffle . Thus demotion 5 stars.That said; my friend also ordered wild blueberry pancake u share wow; were phenomenal . I would've changed 3 star because the chicken waffle currently``a-ok""( pretty tasty; large portion); the blueberry pancake redeemed . The warm maple butter; the same thing they use for the chicken waffle; pair even perfectly the pancake . I see the banana pancake would die-for - though Clinton St.; can't do a blueberry banana pancake?? Those my favorite!: p Due to the pancake; I would definitely come back .

We came party two Saturday morning saw a line going around block already; 8 minute spare restaurant opened . It a cold day; neither u mood waiting outside cold; took a chance only 8 minute . Fortunately; seated the first round seating; the original area the restaurant (have two section are the corner; split). The part the restaurant were seated in the smaller side; original restaurant; the ambience resembles a traditional American diner . There a long wait getting menu having order taken; there wa just one man going around take order; he wa doing it by proximity table the kitchen . The food came after around 20 minute; the pancake looked glorious; in picture . However; the taste not much the appearance- were overly browned; I found affected their taste; were quite average . I actually preferred salmon latke to the pancake; though the potato latke were also overly cooked; hard the edge . Wouldn't recommend place worth waiting.,3.0 star rating

3959,37,Delicious truly understatement . Their blueberry pancake surpassed expectation definitely lived hype . I person like much going pancake blueberry not overwhelmingly sweet paired nicely light fluffy pancake . I also able try popular item (Fried chicken & waffle) This another one came surprise to me since chicken usually come this dish normally breaded heavily not much flavor . This not case warm maple butter made even better.Although; breakfast seemed point; I would pas lunch (namely their seafood po'boy) Yes; the fish tasted fresh after trying their pancake waffle; match . The manhattan clam chowder the other hand wa nice - wa light did not have much tomato.If're feeling; their 'boozy mexican shake' a big kick alcohol they definitely not skimp that . I'd prefer a regular shake tho since it wa strong for my taste.Tip - Coming a weekday help with the wait time . I only a 15-20 minute wait.,5.0 star rating

We also excited food.A lady directing crowd; it around 9 AM . She gestured white couple front u go main section restaurant (left). When asked many people our party; said two; said the right . I confused then realized there back room.Once Asian friend I sat the back room; realized most patron (all) this back section were people color . We felt kinda grossed . But decided eat anyway; especially are used treated second-class citizen time time . I unhappy; this not first time seated like a colored room . My first time being seated separately the white patron at a restaurant wa documented; yelp.com/biz/le-cirque-n…In't take photo this time around since space wa so tight . However; can check other Yelpers' photo the back room versus the street corner room and see yourself there is indeed implicit bias that come seating the patron . That said; the food wa decent . In't know I'd want come back . I want say it is implicit bias; In't want accuse being racist simply due my one-time experience . Might an day . Hey; I do return; I make sure bring my white friend; so I would a higher chance being seated in the main dining room?,2.0 star rating

3978,37,Amazing breakfast/brunch food; comically bad service . I went dinner (breakfast non-breakfast option dinner btw )n't crowded . I got table 4 without wait . We getting pretty cold table seated fan (& middle winter); asked waitress possible turn . The waitress said would; forgot asked again . When finally turned fan off; blasted air conditioning made even colder . This crazy since 21* out.I ordered chocolate chip pancake side chicken apple sausage . The pancake (especially syrup came) were amazing . Best pancake I have ever . The sausage wa good; little dry . The waitress brought veggie burger a person my table instead the salmon burger they ordered; awkwardly tried give u place it . When we asked the salmon burger instead she wa even awkward; eventually relented let u keep the veggie burger addition the salmon burger . The salmon burger then took a really long time make we had all almost finished the time it came out.After the salmon burger finally came; waitress began profusely apologizing to u offered u 3 (random number) free desert . We said it wa fine; she ended charging u the veggie burger instead the salmon burger (saved u a few buck). The ridiculous service not end . After we gave them a credit card the check; the waitress told u someone messed it up that it wa actually (5 $) cheaper.Like I said; comically bad service 8/10,4.0 star rating

The special fried egg asparagus top bacon brussel sprout; snap pea other green veggie . There a delightfully delicious truffle flavor throughout entire dish . The egg perfectly cooked green onion on top tasty seasoning . I also loved bit thick cut; extremely crispy flavorful bacon . It would've nice . The vegetable also good - Quite fresh sauteed well lot pepper spice; it way oily . While I really enjoyed some element special; In't know it warranted the $17 price tag may have been happier the simpler; tried true choice pancakes.Potato pancake served sour cream applesauce . There only 3 them cost $13; I think is a little steep . I mean; only $2 I could have gotten pancake . The potato pancake fried very crunchy consistency is the way I like it (though friendn't think they good). They were extra crispy along the edge the middle more a softness it yummy potato filling . The addition sour cream apple sauce enhanced the flavor made it even better . I got try a tiny bit my friend's chicken waffle . I thought they both tasted average; the maple sauce came it truly delectable - Thick; sweet caramel-y! I also tried the yogurt + honey granola medley fruit: Bananas; blackberry; blueberry; raspberry; pineapple cantelope .

4022,37,I've trying find great brunch spot I thought not try Clinton Street Baking Company? Well I came Tuesday 12:00 PM; place PACKED . Another couple came; hostess escorted table . I waiting friend; party incomplete moment . However; hostessn't even acknowledge presence; leaving standing back corner . Then I realize party incomplete; wait outside - even there 5 chair the bathroom . I waited outside 10 minute my friend; then acknowledged escorted our table.When seated; service quick; I sure happy answer question we had . I ended ordering strawberry banana waffle banana-flavored bavarian cream - seems like safe choice somewhere In't eaten . When my strawberry banana waffle came; I shocked see heaping pile bavarian cream; only receiving 5 measly piece strawberry banana combined . Back Florida; time I would order waffle fruit; the whole waffle would covered fruit! When I ate the waffle; tasted somewhat doughy; okay first; I ate; I found forcing to finish . The accommodating syrup more like a butterscotch syrup - tasted fine it mixed the waffle a different story . I asked more syrup; but then the server gave another butterscotch syrup . I guess Clinton Street Baking Companyn't have any maple syrup? That seems strange a breakfast/brunch restaurant . Later on; something I noticed wa about 3 4 server chatting the corner the kitchen . I couldn't tell if they were just bored; overstaffed; great time management they could afford to stand the corner chill . Overall somewhat of a dull experience that left disappointed . If I come back; I would order something different . However; In't really see coming back . If do come here; make sure to bring cash; a this place CASH ONLY.,3.0 star rating

It a``hype""would say most part really life all . Think all review looong line! So defense; I would also like point some negative commentary bad experience found something wrong . Particularly racist one - location sits literally heart LES nyc . It kind hard chooses path segregating customer mistreating especially race; gender; religion . It would comical anyone even hears . The entire staff multi-racial cultural; customer 80% tourist - I dont think even a die hard Trump extremist would able survive they employ belief a place like! So would baffling an establishment a whole would deemed``racist"". Furthermore even there an unpleasant experience - came one staff person; would constitute a``whole""the business blame . Besides; the endless line; raving review medium buzz speaks itself . So back the important thing - breakfast! I wanted say they included raspberry jam w the pancake very generous . The jam sooooo fresh! Amazing!!!! I found the newly expanded well-lit . It a nice place have breakfast brunch really iconic nyc feel that cant get anywhere else (ok maybe except RussDaughters ...). It still exceptional it character freshness . Customer service also nice the guy sooo busy attending to small detail . Sometimes get really crazy you need to call attention (; come the popularity!). Coffee get refilled so many time before you even try to stop themso get ready for some caffeinated action you leave this place! Cash and also small item can add .

4033,37,This mediocre best.I excited come I heard good review . And mainly because wanted fried chicken . And biscuit . And cornbread . We got biscuit basket filled mini biscuit (And really basket )n't really great little buttery raspberry jam pretty good . The butter little packet is high quality . The chicken plate ordered (sandwich chicken platter) arrived semi warm decided finish biscuit even though really wanted dish delivered u . I really wish didnt wait u finish biscuit they delivered food...watched another table receive food first even though party came much later . The chicken ok; fried green tomato were too deep fried; fried green tomato I know . The cornbread so dry like the atacama desert; we barely touched . In't think cornbread even though we were promised a cornbread . The cole slaw good the honey tasted really weird...Or whatever . Wen't really a waiter the bartender really nice I think that's the reason I giving a 2 star instead a 1 . She wa the only lively person the room . Super friendly cute . The waitress/waiter wa no found the hostess wa ok...that attentive . Honestly you want biscuit chicken go a uber/lyft to pie thigh in brooklyn.,2.0 star rating
4034,37,Simple carbohydrate give simple happiness.My friend I brunch Clinton Street Baking Company famous it pancake; waffle notoriously long wait.For weekday; wait terrible; 30mins walk around neighborhood.The pancake I fluffy overly sweet . They mix blueberry batter well . However; taste bit dry you finish half it.The French toast is even better . Crispy golden outside tender inside; brioche toast is to die . The caramelized banana pecan make even better.Overall food tasty; worth the 30 minute wait weekday maybe not the 2 hour wait weekends.Tip: cash . If you really hate the wait do not mind brunch night; actually diner open reservation.,4.0 star rating

Plus; I've never actually beef belly; it's SO MUCH better pork belly .

4106,38,Takashi owned Chef Takashi; 4th generation Korean immigrant; born Osaka . The restaurant all beef offer choice cut Premium Japanese American Angus yakiniku horumon dinner . They're opened dinner; we came late-night ramen! Just note late-night ramen experience held Fridays Saturdays; 12 AM midnight a 1 AM seating (technically ;'s Saturday morning; 12 AM/1 AM; Sunday morning 12 AM/1 AM). The ramen made a 24-hour beef broth; come custom-made noodle; a 20-spiced red paste (Takashi's grandma's receipt); US Kobe braised beef belly (SO SO SO GOOD - super tender juicy; unbelievable taste; literally melt your mouth!); crispy small beef intestine (kasu); half a soft-boiled egg (organic).We Grandma's Spicy Ramen; spicy paste side; foregoing additional topping ('s foie gras!). The beef broth definitely different - a little greasy an issue those sensitive stomach . However; taste pretty good! The noodle thin okay; intestine were forgettable; I can see may like this added crispy texture (stay crispy for quite time!). The paste added some spice it; I thought it'd similar kimchi paste; however; the ramen already came spiced; the side the paste requested not needed . I loved the marinated boiled egg; the yolk perfect creamy . The star the show the braised beef belly; it had a perfect amount fat it - I'd definitely add baby the next time!!! The good thing Takashi take reservation advance; via phone via email . However; the restaurant is set-up a communal style; if're a single- a party 2; will seated next a group of 3 a couple . Service friendly; slightly slow getting refill the check . Great experience; I'd love come back for yakiniku experience; this place seems know their beef! +US Kobe braised beef belly!!!

4109,38,First thing first; review specifically late night weekend ramen . At midnight 1AM Fridays Saturdays ONLY Takashi becomes temple beef-base ramen . This $16-17 ramen great way get Takashi experience without completely breaking bank (otherwise begin look closer $30 head). Spoiler Alert :'s worth staying late get slurp one these heavenly bowl . One top three bowl ramen NYC without a doubt (much le hyped Ippudo across Village thank goodness) the signature beef near falling apart I nabbed chopstick . The egg boiled perfection the $1 additional shrimp-based spicy sauce worth every penny . Noodles supple the beef intestine a great touch (tasted like elevated pork rind). The base well seasoned I keep setting chopstick go with the provided spoon . Service prompt accommodating; the atmosphere one mod beef worship; the noise quiet enough have audible conversation (though far silent).Overall; I'd recommend to of my friend a heartbeat I think it'd a strong choice a splashy 2nd date night . I'll back.,5.0 star rating
4110,38,"If're adventurous eater; offal fan; definitely deserves visit . I've twice; I think experience dampened recent visit Japan .

Wen't stay secret``secret""ramen time around; chance -! Last time ate standard menu; then ended staying secret ramen; I definitely walked Takashi second trimester food baby . This time around; reservation 7 PM; yet all coincidentally ended area 30 minute early; walked restaurant; since open table; were seated immediately.Niku-Uni: chuck flap topped sea urchin fresh wasabi . This picky; I uni Hokkaido previous week; so I definitely impressed dish . Also; much I try; I stilln't love shiso leaf . Worth try ifn't had; I doubt I'd personally order again.Takashi K-F-C: Kobe beef tartar; whipped Foie gras marinated white miso Caviar Hackleback; served sake-pickled Japanese cantaloupe toast . If I could keep``Miraclewhip""a giant tub my fridge . I worried needlessly white miso would overwhelm flavor foie gras; be overpowered saltiness caviar . I wrong; decadence every mouthful . Thinly sliced A5 Miyazaki Kalbi Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi Spring Garlic chive: scallop melted onto the kalbi our mouth; one the highlight the night; though all agreed there were too many chive . Do skip . We ended saving the chive the side our plate nibbling throughout the rest the meal.Super-tender Filet Mignon Steak Garlic Butter Dip: I'm usually a filet mignon girl; anything garlic butter always get . This is worth ordering - unless're a first kiss kinda date - we're talking whole clove garlic.Bone Marrow Crawfish Dumplings Hong Kong-Style Hot Peanut Oil Sauce: I wanted love; the dumpling blend extremely tender; even a copious dip the peanut oil sauce; leaned towards blandness; is a shock since I can't rock spicy.Grandmom's Steamed Beef Shank Buns Spicy Mayo: This the dish I underwhelmed; I think it's just the Asian me; more remarkable a typical bun a dim sum place; the meat a tad dry . If I'm being honest; I'd rather have a $2.50 pork bun a standard dim sum place.Calf's Brain Cream (tube) Blinis & Caviar: If've never had; this is lovely . It's lighter foie gras; get the mental block eating``brain""; it's a surprisingly delicate dish . Remember eat this pinky out.Rosu (Ribeye): in doubt; can't go wrong with ribeye.Tsurami (Cheeks): anytime have a chance enjoy cow cheek - do not resist.Tan-saki; Tan-suji & Tan-moto (the tongue experience): what an experience it is; you have try this at least once . It's interesting compare texture flavor the various part the tongue.We ended sharing a Madagascar Vanilla soft-serve ice cream made in house; the texture wa unimpressive; the flavor kept u reaching our spoons.Two bottle of yuzu sake the rock kept u company throughout the meal .

Usually I prefer ramen spicy; I found spicy paste bit overwhelming flavor saltiness you lost nuance original broth; disappointing - I'd recommend maybe using half (serve bowl; they put the paste top you mix in). After finishing my bowl spicy ramen; I became extremely thirsty drank like gallon of water home . For Kobe beef; In't think the meat tender a could been .

The wall are decorated drawing description food offer.There good amount drink offered a selection . I ordered white peach soju sparkler drink along meal . It a light clean flavor refreshing . Before ordering; given three complimentary appetizer raw cabbage a sesame dressing drizzled; kimchee bean sprout lightly tossed a soy sauce . For dinner ordered Niku-Uni; testicargot; tongue experience; marinated Kobe kalbi short rib marinated shibire (sweetbread). The Niku-Uni a great start meal . It fresh sea urchin topped a chuck flap beef; sesame leaf; nori a little wasabi . It served a side soy sauce folded Niku-Uni dipped it.As meat grilled presented; waitress helpful instructing u long item be grilled . The tongue experience an interesting . The tongue presented three different cut (front; middle back of tongue). Each cut a different tenderness it . I liked the middle cut the best of the three . On the side given two sauce dipping the meat . One a soy sauce sesame seed mix the second sauce a yuzu sauce.The Kobe short rib sweetbread very tender so flavorful . The waiter told u the meat be either seasoned marinated . He highly recommended have marinated the full flavor he right . The short rib sweetbread not even need the extra sauce . I always heard sweetbread taste great prepared correctly boy were these great . The testicargot a bit the chewy side . It flavored well; itn't favorite thing we tried night . It a texture thing turned off it.Service wa really good the waiter were willing explain anything the menu make sure you were enjoying meal . The check came with gum freshen your breath the meal .

4148,38,They some really interesting option menu adventurous eater! In opinion though really overpriced; portion pretty small.The best thing definitely beef belly; would really recommend . Their tartare quail egg pretty good; get little gross much make sure few people share . The thick slice beef tongue I enjoy; I usually love tongue! I think slice just too thick you'd get crisp starting burn the outside; the middle would still cold raw . I personally prefer thinner cut the entire slice nice crisp the outside bit chewiness . Also the testicargot...huge regret! My boyfriend I wouldn't have even finished ifn't cost much! It sort sauce it tasted unseasoned otherwise; the middle just bland tasting testicle...good.Price also really high what ordered the amount food . We didn't order the crazy slice beef like the wagyu Kobe; got 5 different dish total it came $120 2 people! We definitelyn't full; just kind got sick of eating meat had agreed finish within hour; wa the only way we could seated without a long wait .

Also; charged $4.00 extra all dark meat . Ridiculous . The fried chicken piece small (one small leg two tiny thigh...poor chick). The chicken also...umm...dry seemed like wanted have flavor it so dry it couldn't come . Result: basura (garbage). * Wings....YUMMO!!! I'd definitely come back ONLY for wing .

My dad more understanding I itn't addressed day . I dispute the charge my end they began ignoring email the dispute did they finally respond . Poor service . So definitely star entire experience . If I ever organized something again; I would watch every penny...unfortunately.Anyway; I went again friend for dinner honestly that experience what pushed from a 3 a 4 star review .

4202,40,Sigh ...'s unfortunate I'm even writing review . Review #3 . We started 3 star; climbed 4 star; drop 2 . I use hit spot religiously least 1x week sometimes 2x's I feeling particularly great . However; I began adulting cut back coming frequently explored place . Sadly last 2 time I've (including tonight) left disappointed . Here 4 reason...#1 The menu falling part . May seem like big deal; say dont see need giving customer something nice look since always come anyway . If ripped bent's time replace. #2 The place need revamp . New decor need cleaned frequently . We sat bar tonight super sticky . I remember bar clean every time I came or least wiped soon a I sat . #3 The important thing suffering is service . The last time I came it took longer normal get food when one person got wrong order . Not crazy crap happens . However; tonight I it . Myself friend sat bar it took 15 min bartender even acknowledge u . I'm use coming getting a hey I'll right . We didn't get of . When a bartender finally came asked could the area sitting wiped it super sticky . The bartender went make 3 drink then wiped the area didnt even ask were ready . I finally asked could we order the bartender finally looked u took order . I'm not use the bartender here being slow not particularly friendly . No I dont want braid hair; it would be nice to feel like like the spot you're working and enjoy you do. #4 The food okay the mac and cheese wa off . My friend got the mussel and asked extra bread and took 20 min to come out.So that wa recent experience this establishment . It's so unfortunate because I really liked this spot . These last 2x's I've here left underwhelmed . It may be time to give it up.,2.0 star rating

4205,40,Stopped Soco recently lunch . With many review idea 'famous' mac cheese I excited give place try...unfortunately I left feeling little 'eh .' Overall meal good ;n't outstanding . Here's thing'll want know go: +/- The Mac Cheese good . Whatever cheese combo use totally yum . And like crunchy top - you're really going love one . The top sooo golden crunchy b/c broiled a bit it hit table . However; noodle bottom cast iron pan mushy . Didn't love extreme texture...+/- There no refill any drink; unless water . However; mango iced tea delish...delish I wish I the opportunity have several glass . + Lunchtime sandwich option include either fry a salad . - The fry no good . Ugh; have tried the salad . The fry so lackluster . Thin; average sprinkled w/ parm cheese . Why? It's even shredded cheese - parm cheese you'd sprinkle spaghetti . Toss fry some olive oil garlic rosemary parm you may on something...+/- The fried chicken sandwich pretty good . It's different others I've tried...the biggest difference not one thick cut chicken breast - several thin chicken cutlet; breaded fried . My sandwich 3 piece chicken stacked on the bun . In't mind...b/c it made sure that each bite bun chicken it . But looking a traditional fried chicken sandwich may want try something else.,3.0 star rating

The place is cute appears have patio I assuming better weather month . Now I'll go explain I deducted two star popular otherwise 5-star deserving place giving based food alone . I initially wanted sit a table wait inside annoyingly long even though restaurant empty opened . I still wanted try I decided sot at bar fine do suggest they get a more efficient way sitting customer they first open instead having one hostess sometimes leaf the post is trying figure what's happening guest just wait line . So's the first star removed . The second star I removed again I came right the restaurant opened wa told the dish I wanted to order; the vegetable frittata wa not available . I found it odd given the restaurant just opened so I went the sweet potato pancake scrambled egg instead . The food I order I enjoyed; very much . My friend's wing mac cheese also good .

My birthday weekend come I decide take bus DC NY try out.First observation: Myrtle Avenue come long way since late 90s/early 2000s . The block flanked new restaurant . swanky apartment other business . Soco definitely stood . We walk busy . In't see empty table seat sight . This 8 pm Saturday . Thank God I reservation . I made through Open Table I provided note birthday I town.My eye bigger stomach since In't know I'd back; I wanted try everything . Wen't wait seated . The tall; beautiful hostess walked u straight back our table . It like outdoor extension restaurant . As walked back; walked pas Marc Daly; owner . He's much shorter smaller person look television.Here's experience broken pro con: CONS: The table made child petite people . The first table seated wobbled badly; asked reseated . Fortunately; we found table that wobble . It very small . Maybe 2'X2'The green horrid . I never green bad . It like cook ran green thought could throw; let cook hour'd be good go . Uh; ; boo boo! They crunchy . No seasoning . No meat . No nothing . Flat disrespectful.The drink portion exceptionally small . My girlfriend ordered mix drink it tiny . I ordered champagne . My portion size appropriate it delivered glass flute.Normally; tell restaurant your birthday ;'ll bring something - cupcake; slice of cake; something . Soco did none of that .

Nonetheless; my entree hit the table le ten min . The food underwhelming! I'm firm believer you get you pay . Though the entree came looking beautiful; lacked taste . It bland; for $21 plate; I felt robbed . Who's the kitchen!? Where the seasoning? My pork chop overcooked the point it tough couldn't cut my butter knife . Mac cheese an $11 side is understanding based the portion . It's served skillet; it's cheesy and with a crispy topping; yet bland! I the white sangria drink ($ 9) pretty good .

Would've preferred Asian style (sweet); they tender meaty.We wanted get mac cheese; basically cast iron skillet fat cholesterol . You could probably split it among 4-5 people.The chicken waffle good; though the red velvet pretty gimmicky . Not sure I would put it on best-of fried chicken list; than the Instagrammable quality it.The smoked chicken the way to go . You get basically half chicken . Cooked perfectly with a ton BBQ sauce; mashed potato string bean . Though you could probably also split with one person be full.I'm fat; what I'm saying.Anyway; they have a backyard; is cool . Speaking cool; air conditioningn't kick in until 15 minute the meal; it a bit uncomfortable .

The foodn't particularly special it very filling delicious.1st Course: Grilled Pork Jowl/Green Papaya Salad - I actually liked green papaya salad than pork jowl; highly recommended . The salad extremely refreshing a good prep dish truly meat-filled entrees.2nd Course: Longonissa/Sizzing Sisig - Both these good hearty . The sisig a little disappointing since the piece small some them got burnt . The longonissa more basic cooked well wa great the garlic rice.Dessert: Powdered Sugar Donuts/Champorado - The champorado wa SO GOOD . Not sweet not moderately chilled . The powdered donut what you'd expect.Rice: Garlic Fried Rice - Yum .

I'd recommend reserving --'ll pick week . Noise level high; hip hop soundtrack bustling crowd . I've ended sitting chef's counter both visit; while I recommend fun date activity watch dish made; get little hot . The whole restaurant run warm summer.The menu divided large small plate; though portion sizen't vary wildly; well some bar snack . Dishes range neighborhood Thai standby like green papaya salad khao soi hearty Filipino sisig pork adobo; Malaysian; Chinese; fusion dish well represented . Vegetarians cobble something together necessary; pescatarians solid option . For 2; large; a small; a snack be perfect.When Pig Khao shine; truly shine . I'm sisig expert; their version ($ 16) my favorite thus far; juicy pig head you could easily mistake pork belly topped a sizzling egg . Just simple flavorful . Malaysian fried chicken ($ 28) similarly straightforward brilliance: craggy; piping hot chicken delightful dueling topping spicy sambal a finely pureed pineapple chutney . I dream each.Even loser dishn't bad; skippable . Thai-lote ($ 8) subtly improves classic Mexican grilled corn sambal butter; kaffir lime; coconut; it a bit subtle me justify paying price it . Grilled pork jowl ($ 14) put brussels sprout plate sliver salty meat; just way I like--crispy doused lime; chili; fish sauce.Barbecued baby back rib ($ 27) good quality meat sauce yet failed be memorable me . Baby octopus paksaw ($ 16) devoured my companion; I found looking a assertive kick the black vinegar butter counter the charred cephalopod . The beverage program offer a slim list house cocktail ($ 13); largely classic gussied on-brand addition like curry leaf Thai chili honey . The Baboy Daiquiri worth a taste the nice tingle szechuan peppercorn; a they tend be fruitier the lighter side; I would otherwise stick beer complement the food . They offer adventurous selection with offbeat brewery like Evil Twin; Westbrook; Stillwater offset easy-drinking San Miguel.The meal pace relaxed well suited drinking . Decor appropriately downtown-cool ambiance casual celebratory; fun without forcing . Service seems rushed the wait place order pay can be long (this with sitting the counter server picking dropping); though individual server professional friendly.On a good night; with the right dish; Pig Khao one the best dinner New York . However; price high it's hard to always play your card right everything look tempting paper . I'd recommend booking a big group dinner to feast on the sharing-style menu; though it will also well a date . I'd give a try for the less-slammed brunch--sisig basically ham and egg; right?,4.0 star rating

Being 35 minute wait when my friend I went Saturday afternoon; I high expectation crowded wait time . We seated rear restaurant dark dingy . Upon glancing menu taking recommendation Yelp; ultimately decided sizzling sisig; grilled pork jowl; steak egg; brioche French toast chili pan mee . Sizzling sisig (3/5) This dish consisted meat the pig's head; chili sunny side egg . Like everything else served restaurant; dish extremely salty . The meat practically melted my mouth the chili added a nice kick everything . I still would really recommend though.Grilled pork jowl (3/5) Complemented roasted Brussels sprout; there also thinly slice cured pork belly . Brussels sprout were a little the bitter side; overall; dish more flavorful the sizzling sisig my opinion . Steak egg (4/5) steak tender; juicy flavorful . I'd recommend breaking the egg yolk apart drizzling top the steak . The sauce provided also provided a nice sour flavor . Briche French toast (3/5) I'd recommend starting coating stomach something sweet prepare for the overload sodium later . The toast a sponge cake like texture served a light whipped cream . Chili pan mee (5/5) This best dish the 5 dish we ordered . The noodle a hint spiciness wa coated some sort of thick sauce . There wa a runny egg; spring onion minced pork the noodle . This dish reminded me of Jajangmyeon noodle black bean sauce popular Korea Taiwan . Definitely recommend this dish . The garlic fried rice I ordered wa extremely overhyped my opinion . Maybe wa the first time I garlic fried rice Lure Fishbar; wa decadent they set the standard high no garlic fried rice compare . I'd definitely recommend ordering it regardless of the saltiness of the dish . Overall; I not coming back . There a lot of legitimate Filipino place in Queens on Roosevelt Avenue . The best place the hole-in-the-wall place no one know . Not somewhere they serve unlimited mimosa is filled millennials hipster . Also; I not understand's the deal with``fusion""place .

The menu listed the cut meat pork head; I expected be tender (since generally mean cheek); it actually the tougher/ tendony side a shade bland.This brings the final course: the doughnut . The actual frying the doughnut on point; the doughn't any sugar it; necessitates dipping it in a vividly green side sauce .

Vanessa's quintessential Lower East Side hole-in-the-wall Chinese lunch counter; evidenced steady stream mostly non-Asian New Yorkers tourist Saturday around 1 pm . Ignore line people door; they're waiting their food; head straight register.The menu quite large; complete noodle; soup; bubble tea; signature offering boiled steamed dumpling sesame pancake sandwich . There's a thing $7; portion big.I went pork chive boiled dumpling; standard dumpling shop be judged; fried pork bun . $6.50 total; cash under $15 . (Sodas $2 .) I no wait order a decent wait food (10ish minute). They their best calling order feel disorganized . Do check receipt ordering the lady handing your meal won't help errors.Both item my meal disappointing; though definitely filling . The pork extremely pink soft; which made nervous undercooking; lot water hidden inside . The dumpling skin thick chewy . Chives good pork very flavorful . The fried bun; contrast; super salty a little sweet; another too thick crispy shell . Both item very hot; thankfully.The space could use a deep clean decor minimal . Though there a fair amount table ;n't expect grab one easily with these crowd . Take it to the park; assumingn't anything need sauce-mixing (the boiled dumpling desperately do).There are better cheap eats this part town; especially the winsome Shu Jiao Fu Zhou right the street . If must try Vanessa's; give the sesame pancake a shot ;'s the only reason I would try again.,2.0 star rating
4391,42,Tasty cheap!! Lots veggie option like veggie dumpling; sesame pancake; side veg (bokchoy). The veg dumpling yummy I think may say skin slightly thick .

Slightly disorganized; this supposed be fast service spot.There seating inside it pretty hectic everyone getting take trying get seat . If going eat quickly; sure . But probably best take go! It crowded I there . They also sell frozen dumpling go (bag 50). Dumplings are 8 $5.50-6 depending what you get . Overall meal 2 order dumpling + 1 pancake + 1 side $17 .

Toppings included pork belly charshu; menma (marinated bamboo shoot); wood ear mushroom; scallion; pickled red ginger). The broth offered good level salinity to bring the pork flavor . The bamboo shoot probably one my favorite they are thick cut offer a good meaty texture . The ginger also help cutting back the broth's richness .

They a classic appetizer Ippudo definitely something can split one person...oh man . That pork belly.... tender; flavorful; sauce.. oh man . To die I got Karaka-men . I usually get Akamaru modern; I wanted something spicy time . They're basically same thing; w added spicy kick Karaka-men . Of course I added egg...oh man! I love thin noodle how firm were; flavor the soup amazing always (too spicy!); the pork so tender flavorful juicy; the egg...DROOL . Can never go wrong this place.,5.0 star rating
4447,43,To honest; I actually think appetizer better than ramen those what really set apart any ramen place . The pork bun; though expensive; good I think're worth try . The edamame come seasoning side I love; though I usuallyn't like idea getting something like edamame an appetizer actually one favorite seasoning . The soft crab dish also pretty good; though fried noodle come doen't really add much . Finally; charcoal chicken a fun dish it look like charcoal piece itn't really flavorful appetizer . The noodle; a trademark place; a good consistency especially you generally like thin noodle . I got karaka-men; typically I really like tonkotsu base soup I found this one be very salty . I've gotten non-spicy tonkotsu before though; it may be my interpretation of the spice flavoring . My parent got the ichiraku that tasted pretty similar generic udon soup . I think I'm the future; I would get 2 3 appetizer share 1 ramen I came another person.,4.0 star rating

4495,43,tl; drThe second Ippudo outpost; one much shorter wait.---Who remembers day only one Ippudo NYC?! Now there THREE! (even counting Kuro-Obi outpost food hall) This location shorter wait compared East Village location . If come weekday lunch wait minimal outside 12p-1p . Even dinner bad avoid standard rush hour 7p-9p . Contrary popular belief; menu not exactly same across Ippudo location . Sure; get classic like Hakata Classic; Akamaru Modern; the Karaka Ramen also East Village; veggie offering the special different.Having eaten Ippudo much the year; I rarely order the main menu generally get rotating special . I can tell you good . Sure --'re not going be the classic tonkotsu (white pork silky broth);'s nice see the variety see Ippudo experiment wide variety of flavors.For example; used never soy-based ramen their main menu; introduced the Ichiraku is classic Tokyo-styled soy ramen few year ago; made their permanent menu (the original rendition much saltier - glad see toned the salt bit). During past summer; they had a great salad cold ramen . I had a great tsukemen actually a super fragrant bonito broth . Finally; it's funny see they are venturing a bit the rice realm their Gyudon (beef bowl) special that they going now here--are they going to add rice bowl to the menu the future??: O,5.0 star rating

FOOD: The fry amazing; amazing seasoning; thin crispy exterior; moist interior . The pork bunn't amazing I imagined . I eaten lot pork bun fatty juicy I thought would . I think pork be a much larger piece appreciate a pork's fattiness.The okonomiyaki good sauce a bit overwhelming theren't a many topping I used eating I in Japan . The size pancaken't big either.The tsukemen I ordered (the menu - on side menu) the dipping broth on the side . I never this in Japan (I never got the opportunity try it). It just okay .

4503,43,Vegetarians rejoice! If're looking delicious bowl comforting ramen cold; dreary day ;'ve struck gold Ippudo! This lunch favorite workplace . Lunch time get crowded quickly; we about half hour wait today ;'s totally worth . We group four we started 2 plate eggplant bun--even meat eater agree eggplant bun better the pork one . Each plate come 2 piece ($ 9). These devoured pretty quickly! The eggplant crispy combined a sweet/sour sauce a soft pillowy bun . It's heavenly! Moving the good stuff: ramen! This one the place ha a really tasty vegetarian broth; slightly the salty side it work the noodle . I usually order the veg Akamaru NY ($ 17) a soft boiled egg ($ 2 extra). It come two tofu piece; scallion; a type mushroom; garnished sesame oil . The portion extremely large some my colleague said they usually split a full bowl get extra noodle later since's much broth . Some ramen place frown upon sharing it's cool; I'd recommend it because likely won't finish a whole portion . I actually managed get 3/4 the way done today felt uneasy afterwards lol I couldn't stop eating . Their service is also stellar..you never wait long period time your food come . And I dropped my chopstick today the table wa lazy duck to try to find (I'm sorry!). A server noticed right away got another pair chopstick: ),5.0 star rating

We arrived 6:30 PM weekend evening place packed.We really enjoyed okonomiyaki appetizer I've never seen other Japanese ramen restaurant . We ordered classic Karbala-men really good . The noodle ramen different one would find a Japanese ramen restaurant Seattle . The noddle Ippudo thinner more chewy . I wouldn't say is better since is individual taste . Another point I noticed amount sodium Ippudo is much le those served Seattle . In Seattle always order low sodium version the ramen not asked we wanted low sodium option . We were delighted learn the sodium level perfect our taste.The complain we for the noise level . The noise level the restaurant comparable a bar a night club . We felt that we had to yell order to hear other . Maybe that wa common among NYC restaurant since a couple other restaurant we went to had the same issue . Overall .

Here NY; were three non-pork option; I ordered one added egg; Eric R. got pork ramen . Our server never wrote order . It busy place steaming bowl ramen were coming fast most people . We talked couple next u they finished bowl . At least twenty minute went and had not seen server since ordered . She showed and let u know never put our order and not remember . This definitely frustrating . Once she put in; ramen came rather quickly . She not apologize take anything of bill; wa annoying .

Came Friday night around 8:30pm told would need wait 30-45 min; actually better some time've told it could upwards an hour - 1.5 hour . The restaurant actually quite large inside central bar shaped area another room full table on side . While we waiting we ordered drink bar front told they would roll tab onto table bill we seated . Our wait ended being around low end the estimate they gave u we were pleasantly surprised . Ordered several appetizer well a bowl ramen . Was tempted add the extra noodle (additional 2 dollar) my bowl I wan't sure it would filling . Food came very fast (although I guess ramen is pretty easy make) wa great! The real standouts the appetizer really set apart the ramen spot the city . At place can get the usual gzoyzas karage Ippudo appetizer are fitting a real sit restaurant . The Brussels sprout were a real highlight a delicate balance flavor being perfectly cooked . Walked away stuffed wa glad In't get the extra serving noodle . This place probably won't live to the hype you get the ramen there are plenty place the city serve a solid bowl noodle flavorful broth the appetizer are a must!,4.0 star rating
4521,43,I would eat least week I lived New York . Vegetarian review a non-busy weekday: - The place open at 11am we there around 11.30am . No wait; filled fast . - Akamaru New York ramen amazing . Probably best vegetarian ramen I've . Like; ever . Something the broth magical . The soft boiled egg (add-on) - also good . Flavored mildly salty . Terrific . - Vegetarian bun also good . You get two per order; they're 2-3 bite . Battered fried mix eggplant mushroom; thing very crunchy had a sweet sour kind sauce . Great share an appetizer; not amazing the ramen.I kind feel like review redundant amidst the review this place...But still; it's worth saying this restaurant be the to-eat list you're visiting NY.,5.0 star rating
4522,43,To start; Ippudo serf good ramen; between price it reputation; fall flat delivery . Now I can't claim expert I deny place meant fancy ramen joint; I felt like I paying primarily ambience versus food.The pork bun nothing special yet ridiculously overpriced . People make argument quality meat; I'm willing bet life there plenty mom & pop restaurant better bun . Ordering bun easily most foolish waste money I participated during trip New York.The ramen; Akamaru Modern; great; didn't hit expectation . Perhaps's the Westside snobbery; I couldn't get . I can taste set the ramen aside other place I've; it felt muted . They say expectation the root disappointment I might've down the pork bun; I'd likely never wait the long line restaurant seems espouse .

It came relatively quickly considering busy atmosphere . I tried pulled pork first; it wa delicious! Sweet; spicy; savory; combination many flavor profile .

It became really busy packed soon . Started the bun . Too much mayo . Buns warm soft . Chashu bit sweet savory . Basically average . The ramen tasted like pretty basic tonkatsu broth . Thin noodle . Broth good . Paid extra an egg . Honestly pretty basic bowl ramen a splash hype the name . Extra an egg feel like nickle dime; least's a whole egg.I tried place 2 year ago I a shot . Honestly; it's good the ippudo Japan there are plenty other better ramen place that don't charge a much.,3.0 star rating
4539,43,Went Ippudo around 5:45pm Sunday night waitn't terrible (20-30 minute). I've wanting try Ippudo hearing really good thing place while good experience overall; I think place a bit overhyped probably wouldn't wait 30 minute eat . Pork bun: Good sharing give two bun . I thought pork bun tasty . The sauce they really add flavor though the pork a little dry . The bun really soft fresh though . Would order bun anything try once.Akamaru Modern ramen Poached Egg: The texture the noodle really great the broth flavorful . There nothing bad ramen quite tasty . Though; all the hype place I expecting something put it on a different level than other ramen shop I've a Nippori Nishida I wan't really getting . In't put spice my ramen though might have added flavor? Overall I would recommend place the waitn't long . Glad I came to try this place but I think it's a bit overhyped . It's also quite pricey (spent around $30 after tax/tip one pork bun I split a friend the ramen egg...compared to other shop you probably get the same level satisfaction much le). I've heard the East Village location might better (though saying there's anything bad this location!).,4.0 star rating

As meat; however; I wish cut been better marinated--pretty bland had be doused the sauce provided . The pork rib were a standout; the pork skin rather unappetizing; everything else wa pretty much standard.Service wa friendly attentive--cook the meat tell you when everything ready; is the best way do it . Our food; alongside beer soju; came at under ~ $60 / person including tax tip . Not a bad deal pretty much be expected .

There also lettuce wrap the meat along kimchi a scallion/bean sprout salad eat alongside the meat . Seafood pancake - This chocked full seafood goody served a sweet soy . Overall l would say Jungro prepares served great meat those looking a good KBBQ experience . As the price; I would definitely say it on the higher side . I would even argue it more a $$ $opposed the $$ designation on Yelp . For two u; the bill came to $122 tip we not drink . At $60/person; is definitely on the pricier end.,4.0 star rating

4546,44,I hard time finding place; that personal problem . When walk address; inside doorman what look like corporate building . I went asked this how get to restaurant he said yes; second floor!

There a combo option various meat (a beef option together; few pork option together) then page item could get a la cart . We went the marinated beef selection.The service great friendly .

I especially liked the pickled onion jalapeños.The soft tofu stew spicy not a bad way.In general; solid food and good service.,3.0 star rating
4547,44,Jongro located 2nd floor . There's sign look outside . I think also expanding 5th floor that's open yet . We came 15 min opening; expecting line; I guess New Yorkersn't like standing line . We first restaurant stilln't full capacity we left an hour . We wanted try many thing we opted large beef platter . It's definitely much 2 people; we got try the marinated unmarinated meat . The waitress cook the meat you nice . All the meat pretty good; the ribeye steak a bit chewy . The side dish also really good . The macaroni salad my favorite . They also refill the side dish without you asking! The downside wa it's pretty pricey a korean bbq . I guess the meat are higher quality and they excelent service . We might try go back we more people our party we try the pork dish well!,4.0 star rating
4548,44,"If's line ;'s reason - people flock this place; if say``hidden gem"";'s really's hidden . On second floor what look like office building . Let get one gripe way first...signed quoted seating time 7:50pm . Wen't sit until 8:40 . Had I known; it might influenced eating location . Not b/c I care; I kiddos . Ok; said; waiting area slamming; ton people coming elevator crammed holding pen . And hostess stand two (incredibly friendly) hostess . They snack drink you wait helpful . Also coat check . The decor fine venue the music wa spot-on (such). We ended doing the $87 beef platter ribeye; skirt short rib . Incredible . Also pork belly pork short rib - standout . I would loved cook table side ;n't even; awesome server really most of the work . The meat looked soooo good raw; quality . The experience come all the salty side / dipping sauce; lettuce wrapping onion grilling . We started a cast iron pan; they swapped to open grill .

My complaint that the waiter doted much u; I felt like wa rushing u finish get . I'm generous 3 star the place clean efficient . Just wondering--it legal not a handicapped-accessible bathroom? The bathroom the size a closet.,3.0 star rating
4552,44,This place admittedly kind difficult find since sign quite small 1st level entrance just security desk elevator . We just tad skeptical since first floor entrance bit not-happening sort viben't let fool; second floor definitely happening place lol . It's actually really cool vibe whole restaurant made look kind like old-time Korea wooden booth counter whatnot . We got two portion kalbi (one marinated; one) two green tea neng-myun; one haemul (seafood) deonjang jjigae; side rice three u; definitely enough . First all; beef such high quality cut could immediately see marbling raw taste fatty goodness beef take first bite . Also; marinade kalbi actually quite light while flavorful ;n't overpower meat flavor let shine - sign use a high quality meat . Other cheaper place make marinade taste strong perhaps mask cut meat aren't fresh place hide nothing really let meat do the work; something I value Korean barbecue . They also cook which nice - cooking own meat get old really quick I appreciated the server checking every often cook the meat; turn over; get u banchan the like . Of course you can't get Korean kalbi kbbq without getting cold neng myun wash palette! Something cold neng myun fatty kalbi intermingle well together's like they were made the perfect fit . Would highhhhly recommend getting the green tea noodle mul neng myun so flavorful good a many the place I've Korea . As far a Manhattan Kbbq go; doen't get much better this . If feelin a little rich day I'd recommend getting the beef; your feelin a little poor go for the ssamgyupsal (pork). Either way be prepared to drop $$ $cash since meat this quality ain't cheap . Definitely worth it though since the lack an AYCE option made for the quality of their item.,5.0 star rating

We opted the two cheapest meat; pork belly the bulgolgi . Also ordered the soon tofu soup . Entrees came steamed egg; cooked next to the bbq . Of course; everything came side dish! Dipping sauce the meat consisted soybean paste; salt; I think something equivalent a duck sauce . Waiters come cook; flip; cut meat your meal go . Meats were filling; savory; so yummy . The pork belly fatty thick . I surprised the bulgolgi came potato noodle veggie! It all marinated a soy based sauce; the noodle and veggie soaked up all the meaty flavors.Service good and food even better.,4.0 star rating

4577,44,Pros: decent quality meat; great service; rush; lively atmosphere; legit soybean soup.Cons: crowded; scant side dish (banchan); charge rice; tiny bathroom stalls.Upstairs an office building; crowd people hungry korean BBQ wait table open dinner . Luckily; can leave name number they text when table ready . At 6 PM; I waited 10-15 min for two people . Loud k-pop play background (including older song even I know) smell sizzling meat hang air . While restaurant us silver smoke funnel; will still step with bit meat smell hair . Once seated; I never felt rushed throughout meal service point . I so used brusque Korea lady Flushing hastily grilling your meat service great change pace . The prime brisket (chadolbaegi) perfect start; followed marinated prime galbi . The galbin't the best I had solid; a lighter seasoning some place good texture/quality . The steam egg bland not worth the stomach space . The kimchi is sour salty; a bit different regular kimchi a great pair counterpoint all the meat .

The extended hour allow some good late night eats midnight! I will say good quality; typically be wait (sometimes long one) peak dinner hour . I would definitely suggest ready that; put name; hang at one local spot K-town . They take name they call; they say need be back in the restaurant within 5 to 10 minute; venture too far! Typically; I'll order the combo beef pork platter depending my friend I are craving; I feel is the best bang your buck . If you have a larger party; consider the larger platter!

The place packed they move rather quickly . Since my 1st time; I had no idea to expect the menu wa different . My husband I ordered the kalbi steak; marinated . The staff cooked right in front u on our table . They brung u ton little thing like lettuce; other yummy vegetable . Wen't think would fill u but sure; it wa delicious . The waitress wa patient u courteous.,5.0 star rating
4585,44,"Came bunch coworkers lunch . While quality protein excellent; price quite high portion small . Maybe's strategy ordering big group In't know; felt like much meat eat price paid.We ended ordering pork platter ($ 59.99); marinated beef platter ($ 79.99); two order marinated kalbi ($ 37.99 each); two order bulgogi ($ 31.99). We twelve people . Without knowing portion size; difficult decide enough food . It reallyn't; retrospect; I ordered side order fill table.Each table two grill cook correct protein correct grill . As most nicer Korean BBQ place; meat cooked portioned . The best thing kalbi . The quality beef evident beefy flavor fantastic . The pork jowl pork platter really good well.The bulgogi served almost deconstructed japchae . Instead the whole big platter thin sliced beef I expected I ordered the $32 platter; mostly onion; scallion; mushroom; glass noodle all cooked into much all . The total amount bulgogi probably le half what'd get order bulgogi an AYCE place probably fourth what you'd get other similar pay-per-plate places.The side dish the table minimal . There 2-3 small side kimchee . 2-3 small side pickled onion . 4 small side macaroni salad . Two small bowl fresh onion . And two small bowl lettuce wraps.We receive real banchan; other table seemed served the traditional banchan item . Theren't seem be the nicer banchan item served (like steamed egg pot a fried fish). We not offered rice.Service wa quite good; maybe the experience would have been different had I (the Asian in the group) arrived first get table order . Instead; I wa 30 minute behind non-Asian coworkers so the staff probablyn't realize they were serving an``honorary Asian""group . For this experience; however; it wa not a satisfying experience . In the end; tax automatic 20% tip due the party size; came $360 . I think I ended eating a total around 6-7 small piece protein.I'm Southern California this meal; with full banchan including the steamed egg; rice; tea; much meat would have come around half of what paid . I understand this midtown Manhattan; it's still a bit crazy lopsided the price serving ratio wa.",3.0 star rating

4600,44,Jongro excellent spot Korean BBQ . It's second floor; reached by an elevator feel like lobby an office building; once exit elevator ;'ll find fairly large space filled bustling staff meat everywhere . On recent weekday night earlier side ;n't wait all; great.The BBQ Jongron't cheap; get what pay . The quality quite good; addition quality meat; restaurant's service exceptional . The staff always around without hovering being overbearing; cooking the meat precision; cutting; filling dish are empty soon be empty; anticipating everything need your BBQ meal . It felt like top quality servicen't lift finger do anything could concentrate the food; wa more attentive most Korean restaurant I've . Despite the ever-present staff; also never felt rushed all; unlike restaurant the block feel like want you to leave minute you sit down.We got the marinated chicken; wa great added charcoal top the gas grill to give it distinctive taste; the bulgogi; unlike place just throw meat the grill; came onion; scallion; mushroom; glass noodle in complete dish . Both absolutely delicious . On top that; we also got seafood pancake . Not favorite seafood pancake in the area; a fine accompaniment all our grilled meat.The drawback to Jongro that don't give you a ton banchan . There wa just kimchi; macaroni salad; steamed egg scallion; although I like that the egg cook your table . But you're really Jongro for the banchan; the meat the star the show and they do a great job it . We would definitely return.,5.0 star rating

4605,44,One better spot Korean bbq KTown . Service great even though place get packed . The seating arrangement perfect group 4 8 . If come 6pm; expect wait get seated even weekday.The platter option perfect group make meat picking process easy . Both beef platter USDA marinated prime beef platter great value price . Meat cooked perfectly ask . The platter lot food 2 people; try over-order since the banchan help fill up well . This decision also help not squander weekly food budget this one restaurant . The seafood pancake must! Large chunk octopus large serving pancake served sweet sauce . Enough said . If want a fun night; go the flavored sojus; sweetly sneak 12% alcohol belly each shot . If want to have a traditional korean night however; go my favorite korean drink: makgeolli . Makgeolli a much lower abv; a off-white colored sparkling rice wine; my heart instantly never left a bbq table ever since . The server so nice theyn't try to kick you out even after you have paid your bill chatting one another there's a line people crowding the doorway . I find to a rarity since restaurant New York are all rapid turnover . One thing need work their banchan; wa a bit boring lacking . Jongro definitely one of the worse banchans I've in of the korean restaurant I've to . Food thought.,4.0 star rating
4606,44,Great Korean bbq large seating area open late hour . The price expensive portion size; meat quality better most Kbbq place I've .

Granted; pretty late be dinner; seeing so empty big change the usual crowded restaurant.The waitstaff is attentive will assist cooking food; including telling you when soup ready . My friend I shared the Large Beef Platter (prime ribeye; skirt steak; brisket; marinated kalbi; marinated salchi) Kimchi Stew . The meat juicy definitely higher quality; the ribeye the group favorite . The stew your average kimchi stew vegetable -'s nothing special wa a decent side dish to take a break all the meat.Not a lot banchan wa offered our dinner (macaroni salad the usual kimchi); all all wa a solid Kbbq experience.,4.0 star rating
4607,44,I've here multiple time each visit fairly consistent . No reservation put name they text when your table ready .

Quality great on par the rest best KBBQ Ktown . Portions may little smaller other place a large beef platter; seafood pancake; drink just right a group 3 . SERVICE - staff super attentive the meat; check often we wanted banchan; lettuce wrap; drink refill .

4616,44,Yeah KBBQ great ever personal-butler-level service one? My experience KBBQ always compromise . Either I pay little an obscene amount ok meat lackluster; not non-existent; service ball $$ $someone cook you enjoy view . I found Jongro perfect balance value; service; quality . But honestly; I just really blown away server . We almost never ask anything . He came around every couple minute check on table; anticipated need fulfilled every request lightning speed . He made first dining experience near perfect . My bf I ordered marinated beef platter; filled our happy stomach the brim; the seafood kimchi pancake; could've done without . Admittedly; the meatn't live top KBBQ experience LA Seoul the marinade absolutely delicious the banchan/sides helped shaped terrific meal; in all.Had take one star because the wait . For a Thursday night around 6pm; we ended waiting 1.5 hour a table 2 even though told u 45 an hour . Granted KBBQ the type place you want to be famished but that point; I about to throw elbow .

4639,44,Having sampled KBBQ Ktown offer; I say Jongro definitely best . Really nicely decorated interior; decent service (considering busy get); best quality cut meat.Jongro almost hidden away -'s 2nd floor otherwise nondescript building Ktown . You'll need take elevator . But despite secretive location ;'s like everybody got memo - expect wait an hour more busy night . You'll immediately notice cool restaurant look . It's designed to look like outdoor pavilion; wooden table; stall; stone floor brick pillar . It's super cool . The meat really high quality . They pride fresh; previously frozen; cut beef pork; really show . If I'm people I'll usually order beef platter ($ 84) side samgyupsal (pork belly; $28). It's pretty expensive; well worth opinion; meat best'll get in Ktown . It's tender; juicy; clean . The waiter attentive will help grease the grill; switch the cast iron grill copper needed; make sure the piecen't burn . I love cook the ribeye - it's literally big fat steak they plop top the cast iron; sear on both side medium; slice piece to eat; in front of . There also side stove they'll heat soup steam egg; were always a welcome addition.Overall; a very high quality KBBQ restaurant...you'd hard pressed to find better around the area.,5.0 star rating
4640,44,Description: A pricier; probably authentic Korean BBQ option compared rest KTownService: Good . The waiter cook everything you push meat outside the grill make suren't burn Atmosphere: The inside area pretty spacious . It's better place take date the rest KtownItems Tasted- Pork Platter: The pork taste fresh; some it very bland it felt like I just chewing rubber - Spicy rice cake: Very yummy- Seafood Soft Tofu Stew: YummyDrawback: The price doen't justify the portion size . Go to Kang Ho-Dong Baekjeong more bang your buck . The small size for 2 people fill 3 people,4.0 star rating

4647,44,I've visiting place frequently ever since open . They've raised price meat; I guess's probably became popular . But still price reasonable . I love waiter waitress always welcoming friendly towards their customer . Also; are very attentive; In't even ask refill sauce veggie since always check our table see I would need . Their service on point . Their meat very fresh; I also love their seafood noodle . Only one thing I disappointed one their receptionist is very rude .

Other issue; I simply like this place.,4.0 star rating

In fact; kimchee macaroni salad . They provide big mushroom . They cook for feel rushed . Because cook one meat; they move to plate they cook next . They definitelyn't let linger around .

4649,44,We recommended BBQ joint some Korean friend claim one best BBQ spot city.First positive; busy place; be prepared wait an hour+; the host service generally attentive nice the food very fresh . Marinated beef (the most expensive one) the way go.Detractors: Other marinated beef; beef really lacked flavor wa chewey . The place extremely loud poor acoustic music blasting well if were the disco.So a solid option i dont think would consider one the best Korean bbq spot; this one is more the pricey side.,4.0 star rating

4656,44,We came a Saturday night a group 6 seated promptly made reservation Yelp waitlist system.The quality meat very good . We ordered 3x ribeye 3x galbi (2 marinated; 1 marinated). At ~ $41 per serving; we expected satisfied high quality meat . The service attentive very good well - server cooked the meat u; made sure the meatn't undercooked; timed the bringing-out the food perfectly.The downside were the loud noise level (wa difficult hear or have conversation the loud music); the high pricing; is expected given the location . Large bottle beer were a bit overpriced $9/per . Overall; would recommend you're looking a lively; loud Korean bbq place excellent; pricey food excellent service.,4.0 star rating
4657,44,We told top 3 korean bbq restaurant K-town Jongro one crazy-popular . Our friend fan Korean BBQ one recommended Jongro u; really speaks lot how good place . As out-of-towner; restaurant bit hard find; located second floor an older building look like small-office building . There's doorman door would greet if see looking lost/confused confirms restaurant 2nd floor . We came a holiday weekend around 3pm; place inside really spacious lot seat . It busy all got there seated immediately.There's a big water bottle pour own drinkn't rely on server refilling water dining . We found menu kinda limited theyn't really accommodate substitution well . The two u shared USDA Prime Marinated Beef Platter (marinated ribeye; marinated kalbi; marinated salchi cut). The meat quality magnificent! They all so juicy! Probably one best meat I've ever in life.The server were all attentive . They explained meat on platter; cooked table came back good pace cook the next set . You wrap cooked meat onion stuff in the lettuce wrap . I also love the factn't smell like smoke food we left the restaurant cause I hate the smell grease food stick my clothes hair! But place great ventilation system the incredible vent the grill instantly suck all the smoke . We also ordered the Seafood Soft Tofu soup cause soft tofu soup a must-order him every Korean restaurant . Our bill came at about $140 the two u; yet we were still that full afterwards due the small portion . IMHO; the portion the platter just adequate 2 people . If you come party; I'd order item . Even the banchan is small limited; certainly le banchan compared other korean restaurant . Also; we were not informed that the banchan came free refills.Bottom line; the next time you want a straightforward Korean BBQ with quality meat willing shell money a just-enough quantity; is you head.,4.0 star rating
4658,44,Expect crowded restaurant matter time day . My partner I ordered Pork Belly & Kimchi Pancake a side . The main dish come soup; salad kimchi each person . The seasoning meat come side the meat cooked since is marinated . I appreciated much attention the waiter give food cooking; had least 3 different people checking our meat on the bbq . The overall flavor the pork belly after cookedn't anything special I would definitely recommend trying something marinated . The kimchi pancake much flavor; it mostly tasted like fried dough .I personally would visit only the experience absolutely not for the food.,3.0 star rating

4661,44,I've twice first time I've ever full service Korea BBQ restaurant (cut cook meat front). Luckily; didn't a crazy wait we came early first time second time maybe 30 minute . We got pork belly ($ 28) beef tongue ($ 27) time . The pork belly juicy; succulent; I could go forever . On other hand; beef tongue alright . I've better Gyu-Kaku . I also got lunchbox ($ 8); contains rice; egg; kimchi shake for you before serving . Meal Value (1-10; measure quantity/quality meal compared price): 7.5The quality the meat here great melt your mouth delicious; In't think it really justifies expensive it is . I get it's full service that somewhat play the price . Though that really the case; they would include the tip the price . I'd come here for the experience full service Korean BBQ . Otherwise; I'd recommend Gyu-Kaku at a much better price point and similar meat quality.,4.0 star rating
4662,44,I went Jongro dinner some friend . There's much room people wait . Most customer waiting stay entrance; elevator it get really crowded.The restaurant wooden table seating; give an outdoorsy eating picnic table vibe . The bathroom small considering amount people that could fit restaurant.We got the beef platter; pork belly; side spicy rice cake seafood pancake . All the food delicious . Meat looked really fresh smelled good cooking . The beef juicy tender . The pork belly well . Itn't look like lot food; (group 5) all well fed satisfied afterward . I think the side contributed lot it . Service ehh . We told group would seated next; however group would go first . We told 5 minute; twice; even we got the table; we had wait bit it be set . Our server would come; cook the meat; then leave without word . Just very straight the point; so it felt little rushed . Overall good place eat in while . Is a little pricey worth!,4.0 star rating

He able communicate well cook everything the time came good the cut nothing far fantastic . He also recommended how mix soju our group the different drink we were able have nice soju mix.It's bit the pricier side I would prefer to go over most KBBQ since it's almost like a performance the service staff provide cooking waiting you . I give prop taking this combination duty.,5.0 star rating

There's usually wait; make sure leave name number hostess'll receive text table ready (convenient!) Their meat better quality portion well sized . I recommend large beef platter marinated beef platter . Oh glass noodle also good!! I usually order beef glass noodle other option . There downside place one them that take small cramped elevator get; stair! Alson't do take-out can't order go even you're already dining - bad business move you ask . However; they do let you take home whatever you don't finish.Last least; the worst feature this restaurant their bathroom! It's tiny!!!! Like the door is an inch away the toilet you swing it open . You have shimmy way and try let of your clothes leg accidentally touch the toilet seat . There two of these cramped stall the woman's bathroom . It's very uncomfortable and if their foodn't good; I honestly wouldn't come back . Try not drink much liquid I suppose--have backup bathroom location to go to afterwards . Overall I highly recommend visiting this place!! It's always a pleasant experience and I'm unlikely to go anywhere else korean bbq!,4.0 star rating

4670,44,I like Jongro . Been several time . A couple time larger group; anywhere 4 8 . And I went yesterday just hubby . I think's much nicer group 2 v larger group; though larger groupn't bad either . The wait obviously longer larger group . I think anywhere 1-2hrs quoted larger group I visited . Yesterday went 6pm; waited 40min party 2 . In't really pay attention service I went larger group; I say service really stood when I went yesterday . These server work hard! I felt like constantly tending meat; refilling side dish; cutting meat; etc . If original server busy; someone else . We never to press bell . When go larger group; usually order large beef platter + pork belly + other apps . Yesterday; ordered premium beef platter ($ 85) spicy green tea noodle ($ 12). That plus 2 beer draft - total $140 tip tax . We were worried wan't going to be enough food originally since big eater; combined banchan (free refill!); wa than ample . We left very stuffed . The banchan got wa bowl Korean spicy bean paste stew; steamed egg; macaroni salad; onion; kimchi . They also provide unlimited scallion; bean sprout; lettuce . Hubby like the bean paste dipping the meat; I like the sweet soy sauce . Both are good . I normallyn't like meat; the meat so juicy not gamey all . Also bonus; think; it's relatively a healthy meal - you've got a bunch protein the meat; then a bunch fiber all the veggie . Would definitely come back!,4.0 star rating
4671,44,Definitely experienced better Korean food K-Town Los Angeles; Las Vegas; Arizona . This place pricey comparable others K-Town NYC . There 2 side dish; macaroni salad kimchi huge disappointment . We got marinated meat combo the portion tiny however meat tasty . They charge $1 bowl rice...We also got a seafood soup noodle excellent very tasty . The only complaint the soup wa there wa sand the soup some the seafood I would definitely order again.,3.0 star rating
4672,44,Honestly; In't understand hype around place . The BBQ meh opinion . Small portions/mediocre taste high price left room I received check; supposed happen with Korean BBQ . If're leaving restaurant smelling like smoked meat ready fall food coma; something is wrong . Also; In't a big fan their bibim naengmyun (spicy cold green tea noodle). I prefer my naengmyun be mostly spicy sauce maximum flavor theirs too much ice water . I might well ordered mool naengmyun (more of a watery/soupy noodle v saucy noodle).,3.0 star rating

After a long day looking a quiet dinner bar I greeted someone talking non-stop her cell phone; intent get take call away bar . I ordered mussel . Looking forward a meal I can't prepare home - thought broth; bread mussel seemed appealing a cool winter night . When mussel arrived massive . (Bigger always better!) The first mussel I tried eating large I nearly gagged trying chew into digestible piece . Each chew molar ground a mouth full sand - last washing down beer . At moment bartender asked - I responded``In't know say; massive - I'm sure; I justn't know ...""He responded;``Yep; are big .""I picked larger one put aside not wanting venture metallic mouthful . I ate few smaller one focused dipping bread broth . This meal; I longed; ruined . Every mussel I ate full sand; were also overcooked . The abductor muscle should remain attached shell a properly cooked mussel either detached shell broken lose a fractured piece shell remained mussel . At the end the meal the bartender asked; 'How were the mussel?' I replied; best impression be polite; 'Let's leaven't ask don't tell .' So he scoffed handed check I told; 'These mussel are too large be served; need inform the kitchen they aren't cleaned properly - every single one I ate sand - and top it; one a crab the size a half-dollar it .' I pointed the crab my side plate he worked cover the bowl shell . His response 'Yeah; the kitchen aware .' It's so unfortunate he failed make *me* aware I ordered the mussel . To add my deep regret meal - I to hear and another patron talk me a I put my jacket in the curtained vestibule on my way .' I would given something else he asked?!'

4692,45,This review brunch . After 14 year walking this place never able commit finally gave try brunch today . We been lured online menu showed steak hash disappointed find menu outdated been replaced by duck hash . Don't get wrong; I love duck hash Colonie street ha solid duck hash if I getting I going get . Despite menu change decided still give try . The space welcoming deceptively big (80% table filled) we feeling optimistic . Upon getting seated took quite while someone wait u . We both going go duck hash decided hedge bet go a duck hash their egg sandwich pork belly potato salad . I started the classic Bloody Mary (offer 4 different style) $10 . They get point a really pint serving flavor good (bitter). I got the egg sandwich $13 . Sandwich looked a good seemed almost egg the pork belly too fatty my preference . Would have preferred bacon sausage . Potato salad pack a lot flavor have say kind a weird thing pair egg sandwich . It fine definitely not something I would go back . The wife went the duck hash seemed potato cube barely duck two small overcooked egg . Was just a very dry dish . The toast good very dry cold . As service it took a long time be able place order then server never came back see we were doing refresh the $2.50 standard drip coffee . I guess mistake not realizing that the glowing review for this for the bar burger aspect not necessarily brunch . Won't be doing brunch again but could see coming back for the happy hour.,3.0 star rating

We stopped brunch today definitely solid choice.Today's meal consisted bacon; egg cheese sandwich; granola; two side; the sausage patty the bacon . I'd like start by saying give generous portion bacon . I personally like mine hair crispier; still bacon good . The sausage patty interesting; nice ground beef style texture a distinct sweetness In't noticed sausage patty . The granola tasty a nice mix fresh fruit . The sandwich great; good bioche bun the pork cooked perfectly ('s really bacon). The mix flavor complement other very well.Friendly; attentive staff make meal a breeze the dining room a nice mix cozy/homey yet functional furniture . The corner sofa seat some table a nice touch . I guess the question; didn't I give it 4 star? Jack the Horse is good I recommend have brunch . It's pretty standard; nothing blew away . I happy my entire meal experience . I'm definitely a fan . I almost feel guilty giving 3 star . 3 star for me mean good . I've a few time they very consistent term quality . Their ingredient seem fresh the dish are well put together . Is it enough make come here from outside Brooklyn Heights? Not sure that; if are in the area; you will be disappointed your meal.,3.0 star rating
4697,45,I went last night one year wedding anniversary . It's kind tradition . Because got engaged Brooklyn Bridge . So go back read vow then go Jack horse . Typically I get burger pork chop chicken are delicious . But last night really disappointed . My spouse got big bowl mussel . It said bowl big mussel . I never seen mussel huge . They literally; size baby foot . No one chew up . We tried cut up disgusting unappealing . Putting whole thing your mouth just question . I ordered Halibut undercooked so raw slide middle you could pull flake fish apart fork . Yes; I could sent back . But time kind skeeved . Our waitress came asked everything . We pointed mussel told were just enormous; a good way . agreed said past gotten huge oyster she could eat either . I advised someone ha a server many year she probably advise people they order they are huge eat one bite . She also noted that I my rice vegetable had barely touched my halibut . I told that undercooked an extent that I reallyn't even want it cooked returned me . She apologized said I hope rest of your night go better she delivered check . Not in a mean way . But frankly; a a server; she circled around it wa time the check . Maybe offered u something different.As a server I would taken least one of the check; offered a free dessert . Or I would had the Chef manager come apologize profusely . frankly; I would sent those mussel back asked my fish to be cooky it wa very hard to find server the whole meal; even Our water glass remained empty.And the error is really the chef . They not have sourced huge mussel . I really think that's not what people expect . And the fish have cooked better . And the waitress should have checked . All in all however; is a great charming and beautiful location . Justn't order fish.,2.0 star rating

I walked a friend there a small high top table near bar seated--happy hour bar seating . The place casual queit ;'s a great place catch friend not shout loud background music . Before introducing; waiter walked pointed to my friend me named two drink . Usually; I would find this a little annoying; reason; endearing I went his recommendation . Their happy hour cocktail $6 happy hour beer $4 . Their drink list happy hourn't huge (probably 6 different drink); my friend I more happy with what had . The food menu happy hour also relatively small; it includes famed smoky gouda mac cheese;...wait it...gouda . It definitely smoky; everything it is perfect--bread crumb; ample portion...perfect! We also had bacalao croquette with sweet pickle aioli . These good; theyn't delicious the mac cheese .

But; unless really feel like eating one those thing advance ;n't really feel need come; since's like're going trying something new/different . The decor similarly frozen time (potted plant stopped clock wall dining section getting pretty tired-looking). The star come because the service declined significantly . Occasionally might get waiter whose friendliness/efficiency match year ago; more often's brusque supercilious . And recently; I the experience making OpenTable reservation 7:00 an upcoming weekend; be called the day by hostess said ``'re overbooked time; about 8:00?""Normally; I'd say fine . But``request""made without apology (fact; the implication that somehow wa fault); without explanation the fact that I could still go OpenTable reserve the same table the same time (anytime around it). When I said had somewhere else be later we could do 7:30; responded huffily``fine; I guess I'll move you there; now I to call someone else ask to move to 8:00 .""Which prompted to hang immediately cancel the reservation; and make 7:00 reservation somewhere else .

I'm NEVER one cause a scene confrontational I so beyond bewildered his deliberate continuous hostility clearing plate I politely bring it up . He incredibly dismissive; unapologetic condescending! The bartender (de facto manager point; owner left) even came over told waiter NEVER EVEN ASKED he would make drink substitution . Bartender informed u he would happily make the substitution offered u a round drink . At that point dinner been so uncomfortable that we wanted leave soon possible . It felt a though we had offended our waiter on some deeply personal level...I can't find other justification such rancor . We ALWAYS polite; continuously thank the hostess; bus boy waitstaff their hard work we recognize appreciate . This wa the worst dining experience I had anywhere my entire life .

If I lived around; I'd be least week . Onto service . I think most enthusiastic; job-loving; menu-educated waiter ever . He extremely welcoming helpful explained menu if I've never eaten restaurant . For example:``An appetizer food item would start before ordering (air quote)``entree"". It's typically smaller size meant sharing .""That's bit exaggeration I think explained u risotto . Some his description actually quite helpful I'm grateful . This guy got A effort walk lived talk . As food; I mentioned smoked trout salad earlier really good . In't think I've ever seen salad like why ordered . It comprised many various item you'd never think would work came together harmoniously . I never thought potato apple fish go together really worked well . We also started mac cheese everyone raf so try . It good extremely rich after food boner I table neighbor orgasm it minute earlier; it didn't quite live hype . To; the salad more exciting that say lot coming from a fat boy like me . For (air-quote)``entree""; I had a short rib special cheese grit wife had the scallop a shishito puree . Our detail oriented waiter felt the need to point that shishito pepper more sweet spicy . Again; A effort unnecessary explanation . The scallop dish came 6 well sized bivalve the diver variety unexpected appreciated . Most place tend to skimp scallop giving you 3; 4; 5 wife I both very surprised that 6th mollusk . They cooked perfectly the shishito puree fantastic . I wa debating the pork chop the short rib I'm so happy I went the special . Braised 2 day; the piece short rib fatty; tender melted mouth . Even my wife isn't really fatty meat loved . They sat top cheese grit were maybe a little pasty the flavor profile wa there . A couple drop sweet sauce dotting the plate balanced the heavy grit fatty meat . I would order this dish a second . We ended the meal a tart which wa forgettable . My qualm JtH is that don't offer oyster; even though have an oyster bar next door . I understand I'm the oyster bar I wan't butt hurt that I couldn't get in the restaurant it seems like are really missing on easy money . If they are already ordering oyster their sidebar next door ;'s the harm sending a bus boy to get a couple dozen at a time? Again; a big deal in the end just my 2 cent .

A little hiccup the waitress brought Pad Thai; insisting ordered; sure we never said anything Pad Thai . Also; we were a party 2 wouldn't ordered another entree . We felt bad the miscommunication; the waitress eventually took back the kitchen; she a bit hostile a bit when we first toldn't .

There some variety the roti; we typically opted this one.- Golden Calamari - It's pretty much a cross Crispy Calamari get an Italian restaurant Salt Pepper Squid get at a Chinese restaurant . This one the first dish I've tried I get every time.- Cantonese Chow Fun - There's quite a bit gravy this dish ;'s I loved . The gravy keep from feeling like it's dry too greasy . There are also a lot different type protein the dish.- Scallop Meat Gravy Stone Rice Bowl - I'm not even sure's this it's really good . I wish it came a little sizzling the rice crisp the bowl still; I enjoy it each time I get it.The one thing I wouldn't recommend is the Iced Pandan Gula Jawa Soy Milk maybe that's I no clue I getting into . I saw the word``Pandan""got excited because aren't many pandan item that I find I felt like I just drinking plain soy milk . Other that; In't really think you can go wrong what you order there!

Maybe funky Pure Thai Taladwat; unique item menu.SalaThai by same folk brought Thai Villa Union Square (confirmed waitress). I noticed menu very similar Thai Villa's . But - 1+ hour wait; though still usually wait . You put name waitlist via the Yelp app; though! Decor nice; not nearly glamorous Thai Villa's . The table very tightly spaced fit rather small restaurant; I literally squeeze tiny gap the table get . Service good; water poured we asked many time we wanted refill beer.I always get papaya salad matter I go this judgement authenticity (they make le pungent cater appetite?) - SalaThai's hit the spot . It plenty pungent tangy; fact even little slice lime . When I it Bangkok they would literally throw the lime the mortar making the salad.I went for the Kao Soi - egg noodle curry choice protein - I chose 1/4 duck it delicious . Not spicy; though I probably could have handled tad bit; and the noodle good consistency they got soaked the soupy curry . There a good portion duck a well.Thai Tea a bit sweet always a good choice.Though it's a bit more expensive depending what get; I'd still put this a one my top dine-in Thai choice; especially the area .

The service point; interior pretty; long image Thai temple wrapping around wall; food is just point flavorful . Things I: Papaya salad - held pork rind . It's spicier I'd expected; not papaya-y other one I've; is good! But's big portion; so delicious . Kao Soy chicken - huge noodle soup I tried; the ingredient melding together perfectly . Som Tom Kao Pod salad - I scarfed down's one the best Thai dish I've ever . Loved the duck rind; the nutty flavor; the legit prawn piece add on top . The sauce come is the perfect addition . I actually sad I took last bite . 100% standout! Great family; date; friend outing . I'm very impressed recommend it for a different type Thai meal.,5.0 star rating
4864,47,My boyfriend I made reservation dinner before comedy show; place serf tastiest Thai food I've ever (trust; I know tasty Thai food I my boyfriend Thai food fanatic)! The inside beautiful . There's narrow bar part; it get crowded there's large party waiting front; area towards back comparable spacious . The middle area seems be party of 2 back area larger party . The wall back a big; beautiful; colorful mural; check out sure.Before get actual food part; I would also like note the service phenomenal! Even though were 10 minute late; the host still greeted politely; gently; immediately brought u our table . Our waitress also super attentive; gave u recommendation; extremely polite . Onto the food! It's fantastic! They a lot option the menu your usual Thai restaurant; I love! My boyfriend usually order the same dish (spicy coconut chicken soup; red curry; usually go the papaya salad went the corn salad time) he compare from restaurant restaurant; even he said the food delicious! As for me; I went for something I wouldn't see a typical Thai restaurant; I got the braised pork belly dish . IT WAS DAMN NEAR ORGASMIC! The pork belly flavor; tender; juicy . It also come a small bowl the braised juice; so I used it on the rice that another meal itself! Even though I'm usually a Thai food fan; I absolutely love this place will definitely visit when I'm the area!,5.0 star rating
4865,47,I'm regular--duke moment . It's very solid Thai restaurant Upper West Side Manhattan general . In fact ;'s favorite Thai restaurant Manhattan . I like Thai Villa (owner).The decor amazing; maybe bit much a real comfort food . The place good socializing friend; much romantic business dining; the sound get extremely loud . Not mention ;n't much room . It definitely appears if cramped more tables/seats the norm . There instance customer leaving table unfortunately got coat others' dish . Food good . I recommend Pad Thai Bolan (not confused the regular Pad Thai; definitely isn't good) Krapow Gai Sup (Basil Chicken). The Hoy Dub (Sword clam) used to good; since's grand opening; the amount clam get lowered dramatically--hence; I longer order . Crab meat Thai omelet taste good; largely the omelet; is overly priced a 1-2 piece crab meat thrown top of what would otherwise be a regular Thai omelet dish.,4.0 star rating

4867,47,It's difficult me give 5 star rating restaurant; I think place deserves much . In't know NYC restaurant scene; I think one be everyone's list . It packed 5:30 opening 5pm; word getting out.The decor just spot; wall paper motif gilded border the glass ceiling area . Even the detail the bathroom handle special; mention the beautiful sink bowl.As the food; I struck the explosion flavor Lon Poo (Thai crab meat bisque). With plenty crab meat every spoonful; the flavor kept taste bud quite occupied good way.While the menu the usual classic; I wanted try specialty ended Kaeng rawang neur bai cha poo (spicy braised beef). Initially In't think spicy; have a slight kick the end . Huge chunk melt mouth beef lemongrass! I think Rachel Ray would definitely say yummers! The Lycheetini looked promising . And it wa good; itn't knock sock a their dish did . The price seemed high to me; this your usual Thai place . The quality ingredient obvious care put the dish quite evident . Again; not being familiar with the NYC Thai scene; In't know the place would rank; I a wonderful experience . Thanks and keep the great work!,5.0 star rating

It already look beautiful photo ;'s even better person . The seating nice comfy.I started Petchaboon cocktail - bourbon; tamarind cherry liqueur; more tamarind; bit chili; some lime . This came highly recommended our waitress; absolutely delicious - one favorite cocktail I've anywhere; In't even like whiskey.I got Massamun Curry Crispy Duck;...I mean; In't wannaooooverhype; damn near sublime . The duck perfect - I couldn't imagined better . It sort reminded Peking Duck; definitely something different I couldn't quite put my finger . The lotus seed really delicious surprise added unique flavor In't really kind curry . The thing that bit strange me added peanut - rather adding whole crushed peanut top (la Pad Thai); were peanut half cooked curry that I think absorbed liquid got massive . Theyn't a whole lot flavor (I think went the curry sauce); the texture wa surprising - much softer regular raw roasted peanut; almost like hominy . I think I'd prefer it with raw roasted peanut added top; I wan't really mad the simmered peanut either . Also FWIW; I found the Massamun Curry pretty mild the spice level; our waitress say it wa one of milder curries.I'll definitely back try more of their menu the future! A thing note: it can hard tell pic; there's a surprisingly steep ramp the entrance -n't forget it's there on way; especially you've sampled of their cocktail . Also; the bar area immediately inside the entrance; very narrow; you might some trouble getting the restaurant area in the back it's packed other people trying to leave.,5.0 star rating

The cheese delicious went well olive oil drizzle bread.Entrees arrived relatively fast . All their pasta made fresh you tell . I loved raw egg yolk top the carbonara . I mixed it the rest the hot pasta so it would cook slightly . And course; I opted cheese top my pasta . Carbonara tasted good; sauce smooth with nice kick pepper . My husband really loved lamb ragu well . We actually ended liking other's dish and we ended switching halfway . Sharing caring right? We ended the night a sweet note: orange panna cotta .

It hard choose pasta dish pizza; everything looked delicious; I ultimately chose Capricciosa Pizza; topped mozzarella; artichoke; olive; ham; mushroom . The dough fresh; a bit squishy/soggy center; making hard eat the pizza without a fork knife . There a decent amount topping; though; the portion more enough one hungry person! While wa good not salty; I liked; next time I might either go another pizza a pasta dish . The block artichoke stem this pizza tasted a bit of place kept rolling the crust I wa trying eat .

4995,48,Love decor; place warm cozy vibe . It perfect ambience Christmas dinner city . The Service spectacular well . All vegetarian review: We ravioli mushroom; the sauce good flavouring the ravioli covering bit thick; I a fan . I to cut edge keep aside . We also tried the burrata crostini the highlight our dinner . Perfectly crunchy toast (not hard all; I hate place serve toast are hard chewy). The toast topped sauteed tomato burrata . It wan't a cold dish wa served room temperature; which we liked.For Dessert went the classic olive oil cake; served warmed nicely moist served with gelato . I enjoyed the light dessert a heavy carb-by meal . Only some drizzle sauce I believe it would wonder.,4.0 star rating
4996,48,Came boyfriend had okay experience . We started seared octopus cheese plate . The octopus overcooked hard chew . The cheese plate not bad . However; cheese meat tasted cheap . I really wish came some bread.For main; ordered Filetto Rossini al Tartufo (filet mignon a herbed crostini spinach; prosciutto cotto & fontina truffle slice). This probably best thing ate . It tender flavorful; too salty my liking . We also got Veal Ossobucco . It...bad . The veal gamey the risotto so severely undercooked it crunchy . The flavor of the risotto also sour herby-not appealing . I made far better risotto home.The Molten Chocolate Cake super sweet . It couldn't even offset the vanilla ice cream came with it . The tiramisu also quite sweet; it better the molten chocolate cake . If have get dessert; I would go the tiramisu.The service also pretty bad . The waiter spent of meal standing around talking staff member . He took empty entree plate didn't ask we wanted a check dessert menu . It took u 30 minute flag down asking other waiter grab . The atmosphere pretty cozy a date; the food subpar the price . The seating incredibly tight . It hard get and of the table without bumping someone else's . I probably wouldn't come back.,3.0 star rating
4997,48,"10 star Olio e Piú firing cylinder our recent dinner!! Amazing food; service; ambiance popular charming Italian trattoria Greenwich Village . The dimly lit rustic dining room perfect date night; family friend gathering; weekend brunch; you expect delicious Italian meal alongside attentive waitstaff! We started pasta first course; enjoying Tagliatelle Bolognese Linguine Nere alla Sarda . Tagliatelle perfectly al dente; luscious bolognese sauce sprinkling fresh Parmesan . So homey comforting flavor; excellently executed kitchen! The squid ink linguine came shrimp octopus; offering briney taste sea . I've better other restaurant; still good rendition an Italian classic.For main ordered Tagliata di Manzo (NY strip) Costolette di Agnello Arrosto (lamb chop). The lamb chop unavailable; our waiter strongly suggested the Braciola di Vitello Arrosto; organic veal chop mushroom ragu a bed potato purée . It a great last minute choice . Veal unbelievably tender packed flavor . And mushroom! They magical thing Olio mushroom! NY strip steak also flavorful a lovely sear . The steak not presliced; helped retain juices.I couldn't decide the Ricotta Tart the Olive Oil Cake; sounding rustic Italian . Our waiter decided bring an olive oil cake; akin a slightly denser pound cake . Ricotta Tart came topped fig purée wa smooth texture; a bit light flavor . Lemon would've done wonder the ricotta . We also shared the Tiramisu; creamy potent; likely infused quite a few shot espresso! Their Nutella Calzone wa another popular dessert making way around the dining room all evening.I'll come back a heartbeat more pasta wood-fired pizza; like nearly every table that evening . And try lamb chop! Dishes outstanding a bounty flavor; heightened a jovial dining room the friendliest waitstaff; making this an evening the book!``Oil more""more more please!",5.0 star rating

Cocktails strong; I really enjoyed Olio mule (big fan ginger flavored drink). I forget name the red wine it went so smoothly; ask the server recommendation sweet red wine . I had the filet mignon; meat soft tender layered well different texture . I believe truffle top; around well put together dish . Pretty impressive considering restaurant not a steakhouse . Dessert wa the molten lava cake served vanilla gelato . This wa a perfect dessert end the night; a mix warm creamy chocolate cold gelato balance everything out.This restaurant is ideal a special occasion a romantic dinner .

There never moment water glass empty; probably 20 second I done plate someone take away replace table setting . I really appreciate level attentiveness give diner seamless dinner experience . Looking their cocktail menu I knew I try one went Le Marche ($ 16). Although bit pricey; I feel alcoholic effect time I got dinner; I casually sipping my entire meal . Le Marche sweet; overly sweet; make pleasant drink I would recommend looking squint squirm their cocktail . My dinner date ordered glass red wine; Brunello Di Montalcino; easy drink red since tasted like blend . For appetizer had Polipetti alla griglia (octopus); Bruchetta Ricotta . The dish used present food cute! The kind cute's nice eat while; not in your household . The octopus very good evenly chewy; had much charred taste my liking ;n't stop eating a piece; three . Perhaps're not charred taste can ask them make le charred you . The Bruchetta Ricotta come two piece I would 100% recommend you . It's a thick piece toast creamiest/butteriest/silkiest ricotta spread a piece arugula available top; good I wanted . Probably my favorite dish night.For entree had spaghetti alla carbonara; recommended many others; costelette di agnello arrosto (lamb) cooked medium . The carbonara a very simplistic flavor; characteristic a carbonara dish . The occasional salty bite came the prosciutto bit sprinkled the top; the creamyness came from the egg yolk you mix into the dish . The portion the carbonara may not look like much you first receive it will definitely leave you the itis . As the lamb; it came 4 piece lamb; a bed green veggie . The exterior crust the lamb a bit salty my liking; past the crust the tender lamb that I wa expecting; le salty.At point were pretty full have eyeing the dessert menu just took a gander it . For dessert had the tiramisu the 3 scoop gelato (pistachio; vanilla; espresso). The tiramisu wa a bit a surprise I took the first bite there wa a lemony kick to it! Out of all the gelato flavor I found pistachio to be the best; but I'm biased since I love all thing pistachio . Overall I found my meal enjoyable . It's a great date night spot with a intimate cozy feel . A friend of mine have already reached to in regard to this place for valentine day I recommended that they try it out since the atmosphere is perfect for such occasion.,4.0 star rating

5096,49,My first time friend mine! We really hungry tired attending dance class decided dine-in this place . This place small very cozy inside . We walked immediately got seated . The server came asked liked order - we decided split pizza pie we ordered bufalini pizza basically tomato; basil; olive oil bufallo mozzarella! It took 30 min bring pie . The server bit forgetful time also hard get attention we needed something . The pie overly doused olive oil point we cut a slice placed it plate; oil leaking flowing slice the plate . A bit messy too much oil . The server brought chilli flake well a bottle oil (thought a bit weird the pizza already heavily doused oil- why more?). Anyways; i asked the server kindly replace our bottle oil balsamic vinegar! She wa kind enough do! The pizza tasted much better with balsamic vinegar drizzled on the top! :) Took one star lack of attention and forgetting we asked for example; lemon and then the check 3 time 3 different server . Overall; good food!,4.0 star rating

We ordered chicken shumai dumpling; blue crab pork soup dumpling; braised pork meatball egg rice; sweet sour pork rib dry noodle an extra braised pork meatball.Glad shumai I actually eat; since normally have shrimp's a no-go me wanting live; each shumai literally chicken sticky rice . It too simple missing extra something reminiscent the usual shumai . The soup dumpling flatter expected . While par better one I've Chinatown Flushing; temporarily satisfied craving.The pork meatball really tender flavorful; I'd recommend getting . The rib glazed a sticky sweet sauce .

Normally; I wouldn't able finish appetizer main course; both these on the smaller side; I no trouble stuffing everything my stomach.The quality the food fine; the flavor leaf something be desired . The soup in the Spicy Pork Soup Dumplings pretty bland (traditionally ;'re supposed be extremely rich) most the taste dominated the spice instead . The Braised Beef Noodle Soup decent noodle; the broth flavorless a the soup dumpling; not good dish overall.The staff nice; the atmosphere decent; ; is I'm giving 3 star .

It hard just bite them suck soup ended up spilling my paper dish . Vegetable Dumpling: Pretty flavorful once skin too thick . Cold Noodles (peanut sauce): Noodles too thick not al dente . There alson't enough sauce my opinion . Pork Meatball: Very flavorful; kinda fatty; extremely greasy . Sweet Sour Ribs: Very good! The meat seasoned well . Highly recommend.Seasonal Garlic Fried Veggies: It chinese broccoli u . Very garlicky very good! Definitely recommend . Sweet Pumpkin Mochi w/ Coconut: Pretty good . Not whole lot pumpkin flavor any . But the coconut good . By the time I ate cold the mochi pretty firm . Chicken Curry Crispy Noodles: Chicken very tender well seasoned . Not whole lot curry flavor . Noodles crispy tho . Panfried Pork Bao: My sister loved but I thought little too oily . Overall; pretty decent food . It's unique is good gateway introduce traditional Chinese food people don't usually eat it . Service quick though is plus.There wa plenty of seating (community table).

I walked cashier asked few question menu (conveniently posted left wall (picture!). I decided small order roll bun; paid; grabbed seat (bench). I waited 15 minute bun made per order . I got little bored walked around bit . There self serve station (soy sauce; venegar sriracha); hallway bathroom cool artwork; sell merch; glass window you watch make bun! These folk skilled! As I standing mesmerized the roll; swirl; pinch.... order called . It took time I expected; I ate the roll took the bun go.The roll delicious! The exterior crispy a firm bite not flaky . The inside a great balance of moist veggie juicy meat . The roll tasted fresh light even though deep fried! The bun very good . The flavor were subtle yet tasty . There a good balance the portion; the meat wa tender . However; In't care the seed top I prefer the darker roll have a slight crisp top's ever slightly sticky sweet . But is preference . These different they very good .

To something so affordable; fresh quick nearby treat . I order Yaso I'm starving . Thisn't light snack sort order all carbs . I imagine head inside to restaurant; could different.Let break down: Chicken Curry: reminds Korean/Japanese curry . The flavorn't pungent; right amount comfort flavor'd expect curry rice; potato; chicken; etc . Try! Tofu: delicious mapo tofu silkiest tofu possible basically melt your mouth . It's nice pork sauce/glaze bed rice . Try! Braised meatball: the pork meatball juicy delicious; especially combined egg . I think's roommate' favorite dish . I prefer the flavor the two better ;'s solid . Try! Blue crab pork Soup dumpling: fast casual type place ;'s great . The flavor the soup always a nice amount . Obviously; can get better Chinatown's good.Try want! Pan fried pork baos: I mean; there ever a time you see fried pork a menu NOT order? No . It's flavorful; filling; quite the treat . Think thicker dumpling pork bun texture the exterior.Try! Coconut dessert :n't even know if's still the menu . All I remember wa tasteless In't finish . I always finish dessert.Skip! Shanghai cold noodle: think there's one element that's missing this dish.... it's a little simplistic not enough sauce . My favorite version of this at xian famous food . Skip it! Pork Bok Choy wonton soup: I always order this when I'm sick . It's hot (temperature wise); savory; filled umami with a good portion of wonton . Try it!,4.0 star rating

5235,50,My husband I decided venture dumpling spot heart Downtown Brooklyn give try . We parked car SoHo took train because difficulty finding parking . The restaurant designed a cafeteria feel bench seating you order cashier then call number pick your food . The menu on the wall picture the food; make helpful/ somewhat easier order . The self-service concept different/ nice especially a soup dumpling place a cost effective price although slightly more than Chinatown Flushing price . There is a self-serve station sauce; utensil; cup water it make it more convenient all customer . We ordered the spicy pork soup dumpling (4 $6); blue crab & pork soup dumpling (4 $7) pan fried pork baos (4 $6). The foodn't take long come; maybe 10 minute so . All the food tasted decent itn't wow like Shanghai spot ate in past food escapade . The spicy pork dumpling (w/ Old Bay seasoning) a kick them In't a fan the pork baos; were thick/ doughy my liking .

The cold cucumber salad add nice balance hot meal . On hungover day (worth bit more $); I definitely recommend Braised Pork Meatballs Over Rice Egg . The meat is again; flavorful; fried egg completes the meal . I'll usually order hot sour soup this well . Just few tip: Beware the lunch crowd usually come at noon . I sometimes make the run around 11:30 In't wait line . And prepared wait few extra minute you order the soup dumpling; it is always prepared hot fresh . Seating communal table bar seating for the most part; is limited due to the crowd . FIVE STARS the way . Yaso Tangbao; you keep bringing back.,5.0 star rating

They mistakenly gave u cucumber instead cabbage; we ignored error quite enjoyed pickled cucumber . The soup dumpling shockingly tasty - thin dough; flavorful soup filling a decent chunk marinated meat . The spicy pork one prettttty spicy - beware!

5244,50,Decent Spot Disclaimer: I expert Shanghainese street food; perhaps review may little off.After eating; I really see big hype behind Yaso Tangbao . Do get wrong; restaurant lovely setup service pretty fast . Plus; menu pretty straightforward ordering breeze . I ordered one spicy pork noodle soup I found kind bland; I put quite bit Sriracha soup . Also; the soup really high oil content . . . amount oil could normal Shanghainese food it may not be big deal true fan Shanghainese food.On the staple what brings people: SOUP DUMPLINGS . I ordered the crab pork dumpling I not get a wow factor . Actually; I a little disappointed; I really not taste crab meat them . Perhaps; I expected a lot the review the fact there slim picking decent asian food this particular part downtown Brooklyn . I say the price point not bad the portion of food you receive . I believe I paid 18 buck my noodle soup; the soup dumpling; a soda; is not a bad deal .

The positive that dumpling made front took enough time them wack . The Vinegar paired nicely them they didn't taste good . The soup comparable the dumpling filled water . Lackluster . The wonton my soup broth much tastier than the soup dumpling . There a large crowd American teen seated behind me that seemed enjoying meal palette not matured yet .

5251,50,The XLBs real deal friend . Expensive; yes . But worth . The skin thin light soup flavor rich umami-licious . The beef noodle soup also legit - one bite beef fall apart your mouth . The chili wonton are also point--wrappern't thick slight sweet decently hot sauce top excellent . The shu-mai worth trying if like Shanghai style shu mai: stuffed sticky rice bit chinese sausage (unlike more prevalent Canto style filled pork). I bit disappointed wonton soup pan fried pork bun (sheng jiang mantou )--unlike one might find Flushing Shanghai; the soup inside minuscule weak . The wonton soup 4 measly wonton - they were too heavy the wrapper . I thought the broth nice light; some think might heavy the MSG . As others mentioned; the space is self-serve (I like--le fuss). But sure the price are so high given the self-serve nature . Maybe's the downtown Brooklyn real estate . I also found everything is served plastic paper bowls/plates a bit strange wasteful/unecofriendly . But maybe save time - dishwashing needed XLBs get pumped faster.,4.0 star rating

Don't overwhelmed how many pepperoni slice . It's oily oh man; little dot heaven definitely something else ...'re going be wishing were; trust . They're extremely crispy filled such satisfaction . HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting a slice the sicilia; you're vegetarian opt the cheese sicilia pizza . Probably good those pepperoni amazing . The slice margarita really good a well!

At new location; cooks/owners assistance; server cook it major improvement efficiency . However; the Jamaican vibe 'chill' still . So; arrive; relax 'mon' someone get reasonable time . Enjoy company date . However; I think one feel it's taking more a long time service; I'd say something the server . Regardless ;'s besides point . If come the right focus companyLets get the nitty gritty this restaurant . From experience; dish you get authentic good . I've experienced enough so called Jamaican restaurant around NYC actually embarrassing don't authentic Jamaican taste; seasoning; ingredient; etc . The portion are more than enough one person . It's possible split it with two people depending how hungry you are . Everything the menu worth trying . Every month two; I try a different dish . BTW; the Jerk chicken nice spicy . You feel the heat . The fried chicken immaculate . The curry goat crazy good . Overall; the money value most importance; taste; The Islands get excellent mark . When friend come visit me in NYC they want eat 'real' Jamaican food; head over The Islands . Cheers!

Being the fatty; girlfriend got large Jerk Chicken large Jerk Lamb . This easily enough happily feed party 4; each dish set u back $17 . The chick some the best jerk chicken I've ever; moist; juicy super tender . Served your Caribbean staple rice pea; alongside salad garnish; dish 100% satisfy the jerk chicken lover there.The lamb slightly greasy oily; although fairness I's byproduct come slow cooked lamb; again super tasty great texture.The Mac cheese we got the site left a lot be desired; whilen't horrible; tasted like a microwaved cheese onion pastie.Onto the service -n't get wrong; I do feel a little bad slating; our server perfectly nice cordial - however oh very painfully slow . The place particularly busy; we sat a good 25 minute we even had our order taken - it wa a good 40 minute that (65 min total) our food arrived . This place at a slightly higher level a hole the wall - it's not the kind place you sit take the ambience the restaurant; and I just can't help feel waiting 65 minute for the food on a non busy Tuesday wa too long.That said; may well been anomaly . I'd encourage anyone try this place; simply the food wa really good - finger crossed that they speed the service.,3.0 star rating

In't make a big deal because the server; the sweetest ever; wanted get something snack on.The oxtail huge; savory; tender melt your mouth delicious . The plantain sweet; caramelized; super soft...they could not cooked perfectly . The cabbage hint carrot al dente good reminded grandmother's cabbage (super hard shoe fill). So; those three thing met expectation let tell how expectation exceeded! The pea rice; oh God; gave a taste I never from any Jamaican restaurant...I could have sat ate a bowl of alone been overwhelmingly satisfied . The macaroni cheese wa super flavorful; seasoned perfection; buttery did a dance my palate . In't usually get jerk chicken looked good pas man it wa fall the bone; juicy the sauce be bottled sold worldwide...it wa just righteous! I really enjoyed the lettuce tomato that wa served the side well...it wa a nice touch surprisingly mixed well the food . I also a wonderful ginger; pineapple rum drink that wa thirst quenching yummy.The two owner so sweet . I sat the bar a little bit watched them before the server came got and told I couldn't sit LOL . They cooking a storm!!! My two server Were so much fun; attentive; sweet and kept entertained chatting and laughing how much food I ordered eat of of it and get full!!!

The owner Marilyn super sweet lady! Marilyn her partner restaurant doing 15 year! Wowzers! Congrats! It made feel if I walked family's home greeted right kitchen . It's small food jointn't let steer away; this place not disappoint.My friend I one restaurant decided go upstairs where table chair . The upstairs not big (trust) it homey cozy type feeling . You will notice there no than 5 table 4 seat per table . Once upstairs; we quickly greeted young man named Lance! Lance seems young chef in the making . He is well professional treated u like family! He provided u a menu explained u all about the delicious meal offer . My friend I ordered many different dish I happy say all of it DELICIOUS!! We ordered the chicken wing; oxtail; red bean rice; Roti; mac cheese bread pudding . OMG; make mouth water listing all of . The price were reasonable . May seem expensive; however; the amount of food is presented it come can easily shared 2 people . I admit friend In't even scrap the plate the food wa so filling . The damage of the bill wa no than $60 wa easily shared 3 people . The owner; Marilyn stated our way that will soon be moving a bigger location . I sure they do that they will have the whole community lined outside wanting some of that finger lickin food .

5368,52,The Islands probably favorite Caribbean restaurant amongst glut Caribbean restaurant Prospect Heights/Crown Heights area . I've gotten take here eaten multiple time never disappointed.As opposed place like Gladys; bit upscale/trendy; The Islands more dingy; frill food joint . Everything I gotten menu been excellent - favorite jerk chicken curry goat . They offer two size small large - small a pretty decent size could probably satisfy average person; when I'm super hungry I go big! The jerk flavor spot; I love spiciness a lot their dish; the meat the chicken tender juicy well; slip right the bone.They have upstairs dining area ha pretty steep stair - sure it's the greatest the le mobile; elderly; handicapped . But get're rewarded a super cute dining area; were many time I felt I back Jamaica! The menu say a small extra charge dining; although last time didn't seem charge; so YMMV . Oh; course one the best thing of this place - BYOB! And silly corking fee too.Also; the people work cook there are super nice . One downside is that the place is cash; there's an ATM the adjacent Key Foods case're not carrying enough cash . For authentic; delicious; home-cooked Caribbean food served an laid-back setting; you can't go wrong The Islands!,5.0 star rating
5369,52,I so excited visit The Islands larger; new location . I ate regularly they lower Washington Lincoln . The food always amazing I enjoyed small; intimate homely environment . With being said; biggern't always mean better . I went Saturday around 1pm . It a total 6 customer present that time . It took 20 minute place order about another 20 receive food . The oxtail overwhelmed salt the rice pea taste fresh . I noticed everything precooked I'm sure long the rice sitting . I also overcharged my bill . Needless say I a disappointing experience will not revisit The Islands . If looking quality Carribean food better visiting Sugar Cane on Flatbush 6th Ave Negril BK on 5th Carroll St . The price comparable The Islands the quality the food surpasses The Islands . But you going eat The Islands; prepared long service time go your bill indiscrepancies.,2.0 star rating

The whole thing feel makeshift a bit``underground ;""lack a better word . The food; however; very legit . I'll leave the authenticity discussion others are Jamaican think know Jamaican food . All I know; the jerk chicken I inhaled a week ago the Islands probably among one the best I've ever . Spicy hellishly; the meat so tender; juicy; flavorful; literally fell the bone . Rice pea solid .

That's sayn't good; fact dining area attic-sized room poor ventilation; less-than-ideal lighting; variable servicen't make best setting seamless meal . For u don't live near Prospect Heights can't take advantage their take-out service; however; dining only option chance try Jamaican fare.I able wander thanks recommendation friend; stepping inside first floor; hold kitchen small counter area; able head upstairs dining room snag one remaining table . The space tight; could clearly overhear neighbor' conversation; ;'s venue visit solely food; ambiance service . There were extended period time the lone server gone a probably doubled task the kitchen the phone . Thankfully; were able get order after deciding on side entree share.The Mac & Cheese worth order; a cube pasta's generously doused creamy; well-seasoned melted cheese . Most importantly ;'s a layer crisp crust left on the top; the remnant being properly baked the oven produce the much-needed textural contrast . One enough share; make appetizer a we did; since the entree more substantial.The main dish served two size; a small a large; a large certainly large enough consistute two meal . We ended splitting a large order the Jerk Chicken; wa a wise decision; the plate consists three piece chicken; rice pea; a lightly dressed side salad . The star the plate clearly the chicken; braised unbelievably tenderness that pull the bone the prodding the pork marinated a mixture various spice; honey; barbecue sauce; the creeping heat scotch bonnet ;'s an addicting delicious bite . You'll tempted not to share; given the sheer portion the plate ;'s an inevitable outcome.Also of note is that The Islands accepts Cash Only; ha an additional $2 charge dining . Regardless; it's certainly worth a visit those looking authentic Jamaican cuisine; be sure to bring appetite.,4.0 star rating

The wait get seatedn't long (10 minute) wait food a good 40-50 minute . I get there's two lady working kitchen In't understand took long serve something like oxtail should've simmering kitchen hour . Just boyfriend I about give leave; our meal finally arrived all frustration went away! I ordered large jerk chicken (share) my boyfriend ordered oxtail . The jerk chicken seasoned well I would've liked a little le spicy . The oxtail very flavorful; tender; sweetness sauce helped counteract spiciness the jerk chicken . I loved the side cabbage; the salad sweet dressing OK; the rice bean a little dry my taste . In't able finish my meal packed the remaining jerk chicken go . I would probably come back I ever the mood jerk chicken but I wouldn't dine again . I noticed there an extra $3 charge our check and my boyfriend assumed it the tax . After reading some few review; I realized it wa the fee to dine-in . Take FTW next time.,3.0 star rating

5417,53,I came recently small group; although majority group enjoyed food; I thought OK. And; quite frankly; price this high; OK good enough . After been numerous Filipino restaurant last decade half; mom pop restaurant Woodside; Queens restaurant Jersey City NYC; I wanted like Ugly Kitchen hearing long; itn't stand way.Let's start beginning . We arrived 6:30pm reservation Thursday evening restaurant just few people inside time . As expected; evening wore; table began filling...noise level also began rise quickly; due number people the extremely loud music blaring the speakers.The menu robust . There plenty choose - Typical Filipino appetizer main dish comprising chicken; beef; pork; seafood vegetable . Each category food consisted multiple dish . Since group; decided share family style DID NOT hold back it came ordering . We got the Seasoned Frites; Fried Spring Rolls; (Asian Garlic) Ugly Wings; Fried Isaw; Bistek; Daing Laing Combo; Garlic Fried Rice (4); Adobo Ribs; Spicy Sizzling Chicken Adobo Sisig . Whewwww; let take a deep breathe.So the winner loser? We loved the little fried spring roll; came an order 8 . They exactly; tasty crunchy . The Ugly Wings also good well on the sticky side . The Bistek good; anything surprising . The could be said the Spicy Sizzling Chicken Adobo Sisig . I typically look forward Sisig I'm a Filipino restaurant; something it justn't right . It didn't enough flavor grab attention . The dish stood the Adobo Ribs . The meat extremely tender fell right the bone . The adobo seasoning also flavorful.The Fried Isaw definitely our least favorite dish far . We were hoping to order the Chicharon Bulaklak; somehow they did not it at 6:30pm; so we ordered the Fried Isaw . The Isaw way gamey u it tasted like liver . It wa not a good replacement the Chicharon Bulaklak.It's bad the food wa just average Ugly Kitchen a good reputation amongst Filipino restaurant in the city . On the other hand; the service wa excellent . Our food arrived quickly our waitress couldn't have been friendly; it couldn't save the lack enthusiasm I had for the food . By mean Ugly Kitchen terrible; their dish either use a bit flavoring creativity.,3.0 star rating

5431,53,TLDR: good service; mediocre food; hip / trendy vibeCame Friday night around 9:30pm dinner my mom sister . Given I'd never Filipino food; In't know to expect relied waitress recommendations.We opted spicy sizzling chicken adobo; bistek; laing; she suggested . The first two served garlic rice the laing came plain rice . The chicken adobo just okay--slightly crunchy on the outside sweet; sticky sauce . The bistek my favorite dish--tender; flavorful; slightly sweet beef sautéed vegetable; complemented well the garlic rice . I not like the laing all--looked like unappetizing green mush tasted fishy; strange a vegetable dish.Overall; waitress wa very sweet I liked the vibe of the place wouldn't come back the food . Perhaps would stop for a drink; I've heard good didn't try this visit.,3.0 star rating

They good HH deal Mondays have HH night long . For drink; ordered Manila Mule; Calamansi Gin beer a Red Horse San Miguel (native beer Philippines). Our drink really good checked Yelped free shot (lol). The shot definitely watered can't complain something free! For food; got the sisig; seafood longanisa paella; lechon kawali; side garlic fried rice . Ugly Kitchen make sisig the sour side . I like mine sour filled crunch . If're a sour sisig person ;'d like sisig . We were skeptical the seafood longanisa paella; something're glad we ordered . One the best longanisas I've a nice nontraditional dish add spread . The lechon kawali arrived last (forgot it); but ugh . So good; crispy; greasy . You're probably prone heart attack eat filipino food since it's pretty greasy fattening . But I love indulge sometimes! The service so-so . Out the 5 people were working front house; waiter wa the only one really work . He waited u; made our drink; and brought our food . He never really came u since wa busy later on towards the night so we constantly flag down . He also forgot one our order and it suck waiting extra long food you're looking forward . The others were fixing the TV and or talking their friend sat the bar . Overall I'd definitely come back especially happy hour . But hope they up their service game since many people seem to be deterred going because of it.,4.0 star rating

But turned the portion more enough (we had pack one fish rice home). The fish slightly dry my taste fresh lightly flavored . Once take bite the saucy rice; created great combo.I think my favorite wa the pleasure of eating the food your hand seeing the whole presentation the bamboo leaf . I would come back try the individual dish . But definitely grab 3 friend try the Kamayan! Gets crowded a Friday!,4.0 star rating
5447,53,I really excited come friend . Back west coast lot Filipino cuisine; I very familiar with flavor . Ugly Kitchen didn't deliver . I Adobo rib; it tasted nothing like adobo .

Our waitress seemed cranky night loud customer kept coming; they many seemed know staff member . I kept ordering drink they tasted like juice; they're supposed be alcoholic (maybe's they cheap $6). I think the bartender finally got the hint made my last drink strong; wa redeeming factor.We left little the live music came on; it wa super loud and they performing karaoke song; I would rather listened the recorded music wa played earlier night .

Also; lot the dishes/entrees small portioned the price point --'re probably the size tapas.One final thing add that the drink menu seems great; the pour the alcohol skimpy--hardly tasted liquor our drink . Food ordered listed: Appetizers: Salt & Pepper Squid - great Spring Rolls/Egg roll - decent Fries--decent Entrees: Adobo Ribs - salty Adobo Chicken - saltyUgly Spaghetti - meh over-cooked pasta texture~~ Longsilog - GREAT! small portionsBistek - SUPER SALTY the Beef w/ Bone Marrow Dish - SUPER SALTY,2.0 star rating

This my first time trying bone marrow while isn't type dish I'd crave anytime soon; I glad tasted Boucherie . When trying something first time; I always prefer getting from best spot . And better place Boucherie; literally translates butchery French . Our ribeye absolutely phenomenal . It such large serving that we take home (happy face). We ask medium they must aired side caution overcook; is we got a medium rare; were happy our meal regardless . We finished our already extravagant meal some dessert kusmi tea . We chose bombe glacee . Pleasant presentation a server pouring the chocolate sauce top of the ice-cream a cookie bottom right front of . Be ready boomerang though theyn't give you advance notice they pour the sauce the moment the plate hit table . Dessert delicious had a good chocolate-ice-cream ratio; I prefer their profiterole a lot . The Bb detox tea I ordered green tea with yerba mate I'm glad didn't have that much caffeine it since I sure the large steak I consumed going keep at night .

For combination; don't even add $26 prix-fixe price . So yeah; I guess's Boucherie post it menu restaurant week online...cause definitely intrigue . The price average high; I'd recommend going normal menu item instead waiting for restaurant week deal.So...all decided order something normal menu . 1 . Food (4/5) I got beef bourguignon.- Plus: The display def appealing . The beef inside tender go nicely w reduced red wine sauce (bit acidic sweet; very complementary indeed). - Minus: My beef really fatty some part . The skin outside prob overseared . It very hard chew; despite wonderful texture inside . I got taste bit my friend's NY strip wa not impressed . The hanger steak looked better . 2 . Service (3/5): The service subpar; server not attentive all . 3 . Atmosphere (3/5): The restaurant may look spacious homey; since table put close each; can feel lack privacy esp . the place get crowded . Even the waiter difficulty moving around (someone actually knocked glass of wine onto patron). I'd not go for date want to have catch dinner w friends..,4.0 star rating

We ordered mushroom ravioli scallop start; followed duck confit filet mignon (medium rare); finished a pistachio bomb glace dessert . Everything delicious; I personally thought appetizer outshone the main ('s good a steak get; they also pretty hefty portion so I quite full then). Especially the scallop .

5612,54,Highly recommend: - Saint Jacques la provencale (scallop) - $26- Moules Basquaises (mussel) - $23When Boucherie opened second location I knew I visit; bring SO since I've talking ear favorite restaurant city . This location give different vibe west village location; park ave give group night; even family dinner night; open space; west village more romantic intimate . Since I've west village location; birthday; I knew exactly appetizer I wanted try his first experience . The complimentary bread; olive; pepper delicious . The olive pitted (yes) overly salty! Where guy get olive?? The mussel & scallop must . The mussel cooked delicious white wine reduction find using two piece bread; come; soak all soupy goodness end . The scallop change life forever they cooked perfection; rubberiness . I floored first time I scallop; floored second time . Just get scallop mussel - regret it.For main entree; my SO got Faux-Filet Bercy (16oz bone-in NY strip) cooked medium rare I opted try Saturday special; Bourguignon . The beef Bourguignon tender savory; come a hearty helping; I managed finish one myself gave my SO . I definitely recommend sharing dish someone quite massive one person eat; also get saltier more bite have so sampling other item eating bourguignon will help breakup in-between bite palette . I also a bite steak flavor profile simplistic; overbearing; cooked a perfect medium rare.For dessert; had get pistachio; simply I love pistachio dessert the bomb.com . It a big half dome scoop ice cream top a 1/4 inch brownie chocolate glaze drizzled all . The ice cream had chunk pistachio embedded it; the brownie delicious well it (it is overly sweet); the chocolate glaze the factor tied the entire dessert together . If are a huge chocolate fan ask you drizzle the chocolate; your waiter typically it you . For me; dining Boucherie always more experience simply going a nice dinner . The ambiance; the waitstaff; the food; the company you choose share the moment all becomes part your overall experience .

It's something I would recommend skipping.The last time I came; I fell love the Tomahawk Ribeye . This time; I decided try the 36 oz dry-aged porterhouse . Although good; doen't measure the ribeye . One side the porterhouse came medium requested the other smaller side a bit dry overcooked . Given the choice the two; I would definitely pay a little for the Tomahawk Ribeye a the quality justifies the price.My absolute favorite item the night wa the Pistachio Bombe Gracee . I'm usually a big dessert person must the best dessert I've had all year . It comprised pistachio ice cream just the perfect amount a layer brownie .

He said he enjoyed medium; the future would order it medium rare - - note future self others . Surprisingly; somehow saved room a couple bite dessert . The pistachio bombe glacée is worth every kcal is a mercifully small portion still won't leave any sugar lover unsatisfied . The presentation the dessert is part the fun . The server brought a scoop pistachio ice cream girded a foundation deliciously dense brownie proceeded pour a gorgeous coating smooth chocolate fudge it . I wish I could have enjoyed more; I wa way full dinner . However; I would recommend visiting even dessert you can.After finished dessert wine; the GM; Vesna wa kind enough visit our table even gave u a brief tour the new space .

High ceiling; low lighting; cloth napkin; candlelit table; works.// FoodOut the food I tried tonight; I really enjoyed the steak; salmon scallop . The steak not appetizingly prepared (insta-worthy); cooked well also - soft pink the middle . The bone marrow delicious fatty . It could have used a pinch salt; everyone very happy it . The scallop perfectly cooked the accompanying tomato spinach went well it . The salmon the favorite my table . Absolutely amazing! It crispy the outside raw the inside - perfect mix texture taste . We also enjoyed the cheese puff the steak tartare for starter! // CocktailsThe two cocktail I tried the Boucherie Old Fashioned the Franco Mexican War . Both were superb . The old fashioned a sweetness it reminded ice cream . The Mexican War my favorite the two: nice smoky; the perfect balance of alcohol.Overall; I wa very happy the space; atmosphere meal tonight!,4.0 star rating

5649,55,Very disappointing experience . I love Moroccan food looking forward try restaurant; ultimately poorly executed vegetable tagine off-putting service made an unpleasant experience.After reading large portion size previous yelp review; I planning splitting lamb tagine . However; mentioning request my server; balked idea sharing convinced u get vegetarian chicken tagine instead . The chicken tagine appetizer good; the vegetarian one wa literally boiled vegetable . They unbearably mushy had flavor all . Instead thick sauce; wa sauce be seen; water . Not worth the $28 . We really regretted going our original plan splitting the lamb . Overall; disappointing experience would go back . If want good tagine; go Cafe Mogador a few block away instead.,2.0 star rating
5650,55,"Chouchou romantic Moroccan space edge Alphabet City . Despite sexy setting ;n't best spot first date ;'ll stuffing dip meat can eat . I chose birthday dinner instead . This work well a group dinner assuming everyone's pay $30 - 40 pre-tax; tip; drink enormous amount food.The experience a bit bumpy start . Initially a ton people standing bar no one seat; extremely loud music; felt weird be sitting a little back nook able hear other . The crowd situation calmed over course night; music continued be loud; somewhat out-of-place a lot old ballad . Once ran ABBA song; decided keep streak; if I wanted nearly an hour Swedish pop; I would've watched half Mamma Mia (Here We Go Again).Wine another strange spot --'s an almost entirely French list; very pricey . The list site look quite reasonable; I remembered the printed list largely the $80 . We a couple bottle rose; later a South American red . Both standard . Theyn't keep the rose chilled; waiting get cold awkward.A mountain appetizer soon arrived--hummus; baba ganoush; red pepper spread; deviled egg; pita bread . The deviled egg the crowd favorite . Nothing else stood particular.The main presented elaborately jewel-toned tagines little enamel pot . More u the former the latter; the lamb tagine a big winner . The couscous tasted pretty out-of-the-box; though prettily decorated flower petal . The sausage I tried tasted super funky to; others agreed; one my friend liked much ended going back dinner; your mileage may vary.They were the lobster tagine; I went the fish replacement our waitress talked . It super dry flavorless...I think the slow low cooking stylen't translate well . In't often get feedback dish In't like; when the waitress asked me how I had to say . They handled well ended up comping it.Service rubbed me the wrong way the start; over the course the night a great job with several large group a lot dishware . The space awesome; the music is just so off deafening it cancel out the cool vibe me (and this even we asked them to turn it down). A copious amount wine helped u get comfortable though.Overall; I thought the price high what get; not in term quantity in term quality . There wa nothing I tried that made me think``I to go back .""If you're looking for a group dinner in this neck of the wood; are good accommodating; far a Moroccan food go I wan't impressed.",3.0 star rating
5651,55,This first experience dining restaurant advertising Moroccan cuisine; I speak authenticity . Regardless; food tasted damn good . Bib gourmand status well deserved.The menu quite simple - choose one 4 tagines (lamb; chicken; lobster; vegetarian) one 4 couscous (lamb chop; kefta; chicken; merguez; royal [sample previous 4] ). You'll get a starter share; including hummus; pita; baba ganoush...asked a few refill pita staff happily obliged! The lamb tagine fantastic - lamb shank huge the meat incredibly tender; flavorful fell right the bone . Was not nearly impressed the couscous...I found to a bit bland; the accompanying meat a bit dry; perhaps I immediately comparing to the lamb tagine . A couple thing detracted the experience:1) Windows door wide open; fresh air I suppose; it a hot summer night there no AC...sweating bullet the end of my meal.2) It REALLY dark (attempt romantic atmosphere?); I could barely see my fiancee across the table had trouble distinguishing different component my dish; time I poking at the plate blindly hehe,4.0 star rating

5653,55,I think I might love Moroccan food . From mint tea plate marinated olive ;'ll discover everything flavorful you leave very satisfied.The pace moved little slowly Thursday evening dinner; nice change (vs. hurry eat; need table type meal); I started a glass wine after ordering; were served hummus; a plate warm pita other side dish (very good).Now lamb tagine . WOW; wa fall bone good; let just sit and eat the entire thing myself good; lol . We also got the royal couscous (you get a little everything) and though it wa quite tasty; I couldn't stop eating the lamb . I'll back soon!,4.0 star rating
5654,55,"A lot positive . A``concern"".Service great . Cozy friendly spot . The wait staff overwhelmed did best (are putting much food many plate bowl very tight space).Note - VERY noisy crowd let alone high volume music (mainly ABBA classic rock). You could converse someone across table.Now main attraction - food . Limited menu very high value the $. All entree come a ridiculous amount starter - good - finished maybe half . And unlimited pita bread.Five folk ordered the tagines - chicken; lamb; veggie - were great . Where stumbled on the couscous - should their strong suite . The``royal plate""came 2 sausage were well the mark Moroccan fare . The special``grilled fish""completely dried flavorless (did offer replace).Damages a party 8 including tip and 4 bottle wine $660.Do give a try stick the tagines.",4.0 star rating
5655,55,Had wonderful dinner friend . This restaurant been bookmarked recently I would like try different cuisine . The decor exotic; felt like dining nice cave :) The menu straightforward; select Tagine couscous like; I would say two girl; may order one Tagine share; plus appetizer and/or dessert . We picked lamb Tagine; so tender; a bit sweet sour (plum it) flavorful . The devil egg very tasty well . The Chefs from Morocco . We also enjoyed dessert Mahalabia Moroccan mint tea . Mahalabia must-have; too sweet; taste almond creamy texture so refreshing comforting . The service wa great; the French lady served u a great job introducing the menu interacting with the customer . Absolutely come back!,5.0 star rating
5656,55,Sadly; Chouchou authentic Moroccan restaurant . That becomes quickly obvious beginning; kemia featuring pita rather khobz baba ganoush rather zaalouk - not mention presence all hummus along total absence harissa . Later; sticky rough couscous came one our entree reconfirmed the lack authenticity.But perhaps disappointing the lamb tajine; in Chouchou's case simply room temperature lamb shank bed sweet sauce various fruit . No stew no vegetable whatsoever . While the meat obviously slow-cooked incredibly tender; wa also astonishingly bland - absolutely nothing resembling the strong spiced flavor profile customary to Moroccan tajines.If place represented a something than Moroccan; perhaps'd passable - given is a self-proclaimed Moroccan restaurant; I think even 2* might quite generous.,2.0 star rating
5657,55,Lighting really dark; atmosphere must romantic?? The menu super simple . I ordered lamb tagine meat flavorful succulent . The appetizer mostly mediocre the big spread the table quite impressive . All the dish big-portioned I surprised anyone still room dessert such feast.,4.0 star rating
5658,55,I wish I could justify giving restaurant 4-stars doe; doe *very* well . But I just enough nitpicks experience end giving only 3 stars.First; restaurant harder find an underground cavern (what decor make look like; fact)! There's absolutely name-plate announcing restaurant beige curtain drawn closed...good luck locating place! I passed by *twice* I realizedn't odd apartment building! Second; service bit...inept . While wait staff pleasant; prompt delivering drink; did great job explaining menu; fumbled rest their work . The first major problem didn't give u correct order--had go back forth them bit get everything asked . The second issue didn't give 9-person party enough individual bowl sharing spoon dish . Given's cold flu season; wanted avoid cross-contaminating food sharing! Yet took few round back-and-forth get all silverware needed; delaying meal.Finally; food mixed bag . The huge spread appetizer came main meal absolutely wonderful allowed u sample variety delicious taste . Furthermore; all lamb dish worth the price admission . The lamb tahine; lamb chop; the special lamb kebab wonderfully spiced melt-in-your-mouth level delicious . I also enjoyed my cup of mint tea; flavorful; delicately sweet; went well the spiced meal.However; of the meal reallyn't worth the $35+ charged . The chicken came the couscous wa overly dry the lobster tahine featured lobster that wa very overcooked rather flavorless . Finally; the dessert wa disappointing; especially the high price charged . The matcha green tea cooky were tiny left a weird bitter after-taste my mouth that I wanted another dessert take . When crave a dessert right eating dessert; something gone direly wrong! Overall; decide visit this restaurant; I suggest you carefully look the street address make sure you don't overlook it and stick to the lamb dish and the mint tea . Everything else the menu is rather disappointing!,3.0 star rating

5677,55,"Well Chouchou newest addition Pardon My French family; time around're entering realm Moroccan cuisine . Prior visit I never Moroccan food no idea expect term ingredient flavor; if PMF behind I knew I give shot.The space small intimate; seat around 25 people . Two large window grace front; inside's dim candlelight . The wall cavernous cave-like; serving open space while also providing rustic coziness . The ambient lighting cast romantic shadow curve wall . A small bar located left; spa-like bathroom towards back . Next bathroom door'll actually see small ladder leading loft like area where store tagines (pottery use cook dish name; pronounced``ta-gene""). Music kept mellow volume; peaceful warm . In short; know make presence ambiance lovely! The waitstaff really go beyond make feel welcome; take time explaining menu those unfamiliar cuisine . When inquired their beer offering; one waitress brought every bottle beer show u bottle chat little . Like restaurant would bring dessert cart; for beer! We went delicious wheat option . Each entree come selection seasonal appetizer . The following brought table: Harissa spiced almond; selection olive; two deviled egg; roasted pepper onion; roasted eggplant; pita bread . First; presentation absolutely stunning . All their plate ware colorful quality; laid our table like a feast . It such a fantastic introduction cuisine . The deviled egg the creamiest I've ever; the roasted pepper melt mouth savory sweet; In't even like olive these they best I've ever a long shot . They also small container harissa each table- a slightly spicy cumin scented paste . You can put anything want; I liked best by pita . I ordered the chicken tagine partner ordered the Merguez couscous . The tagine pottery absolutely beautiful . Every plate bowl a work art; nothing impressive a they bring these heavy piece pottery bright color ornate etching; lift up reveal a piping hot meal . My chicken literally fell the bone; came olive onion pepper potato....a hearty portion . There a good amount spice the dish not a hot sense . There are many flavor aroma they hit different area of the tongue . The couscous come deconstructed- usually word immediately turn off . Don't make assemble my meal! But it absolutely worked . The couscous came a large curved bowl rose petal; chickpea; onion; pepper on top . In another bowl a rich beef broth; finally on a plate the sausage . By itself; the sausage first tasted dry they soften mouth when the flavor really coat your tongue- this is the beef broth! So when you add them altogether; the dish come alive; all without the sausage couscous getting soggy . This phenomenal; some of the best couscous I've ever had.And; the actual dessert tray brought . They three different kind of dessert; many made almond . We elected try the cigar: almond paste rolled phyllo dough . Their mint tea is also a MUST finish your meal . I hate mint; their tea mild aromatic and helped to digest the heavy meal . It also served the beautiful art deco style glass . My partner is Lebanese and said this wa the closest meal ha had in NYC reminds of family cooked . He want to bring his mom! This wa such amazing experience; I'm really glad I made effort to try something of my comfort zone . The PMF family made u feel like family; can't wait to come back: )",5.0 star rating

5772,57,Amazing experience . This perfect restaurant book . 1 . Natural wine . 2 . Amazing pasta . 3 . Small portion clean flavors.I not believe good tuna tartare braised turnip . They immaculate get . As non meat eater boyfriend I find selection pasta be limited; squid ink spaghetti a wonderful choice really shined the sauce department . I thought my monkfish just ok will surely stick pasta future visit . The agnolotti came a curry sauce (I totally forgot vadouvan assumed a cheese surprised the dish came) had unconventional flavor; if dig sweet potato you would like . A vegetarian dish it best . The turtle tarte dessert wa also fantastic . I thought service wa all around amazing and all dish came quickly . BUT apparently didn't come quick enough . When girl handed u the check said the kitchen apologized entree coming late offered to comp one our dessert . OMG . Faro perfect.,5.0 star rating

5774,57,Underwhelming experience . The pasta bland price; I could MUCH better pasta elsewhere . My wife I shared 3 pasta dishes:1 . Bucatini - This seemed like dish ashamed call chicken alfredo sauce's pretty much it reminded . Throwback 1995.2 . Squid Ink Spaghetti - Appreciated amount crab apart that much going here . I barely tasted uni . I hoping for some kind magic saltiness uni the sweetness of the crab the dish obviously muggle born.3 . Caramelle - This had good flavor . The beef ragu mixed porky goodness it's hard go wrong there.I add the pasta cooked al dente to liking TBH that is the minimum I expect any decent Italian joint let alone Michelin starred one . If expectation weren't high; I might've gone 3 star we left the restaurant disappointed.,2.0 star rating
5775,57,This place definitely deserving it Michelin star . Came here super cold Sunday night dinner friend . Called 20mins we arrived requesting two counter seat near kitchen we accommodated . It's weird looking area mostly warehouse In't notice real signage front restaurant . The interior minimalist; brightly lit filled people happily enjoying experience . I dropped my coat coat check we quickly seated back counter exactly requested . I love sitting watching chef meticulous attention detail . The interior decor vibe such nice balance upscale casual . We ordered glass Barbera NV then ordered bunch menu item share . AppetizersChicories: This salad really hearty leaf good amount texture . The stilton quite strong kick luckily a small amount . The walnut seemed candied a little sweetness gave crunch the salad . The anchovy vinaigrette dressing the right amount salad a little funk the anchovy . Good dishFoie Gras Tart: I know foie gras might be considered cruel; it truly one life's great culinary delight . This my favorite dish the night . The foie gras wonderfully rich creamy the tart perfectly crisp the bottom . It came sweet apple butter? pickled? apple some acid . The puffed grain reminded popcorn flavor mostly for much appreciated crunch . FantasticEntreesSquid Ink Spaghetti: The squid ink pasta perfectly al dente a little bit the mineral tang the squid ink . The sauce crab; uni chili perfectly balance creamy chunky texture along some heat . Good DishStripped Bass: This my favorite entree; the bass perfectly cooked a crisp skin . The oyster mushroom accompaniment went along really well some varying texture chew . Great amount salt crunch . The cream sauce the bottom absolutely amazing . Just wish came a larger portion! DessertWe really full this point....but decided get two dessert anywaySweet Potato Ice Pie: This sounded interesting different; we ordered it . My friend a little bit concerned that it could not much flavor; boy she wrong . The crunchy topping tasted a hint everything bagel seasoning; a decent amount salt . The sweet potato filling luxuriously creamy smooth . On the bottom an olive oil cake . Having a bit it together one spoonful so good . Turtle Tart: This also really good; this seems like a very popular dish available a wide variety restaurant . The tart shell perfectly crisp; the filling wa a great mix chocolate gooey caramel . The tweel top gave a great crunch a little bit of salt balance all the sweet . The service wa efficient on point . Refilling water it wa barely half swapping silverware every course . I definitely need come back try of their menu!,5.0 star rating

5793,57,This chic neighborhood restaurant . We ordered homemade bread cultured butter foodie grass is served honey whipped pea . Both delicious; building already high expectation pasta . For our main ordered squid ink pasta crab chicken confit . Both pasta (made house) perfect-texture; flavor; everything point . But flavor profile overall dish underwhelming both . I loved the combination the jalapeño crab; would loved a squeeze lemon add brightness . The chicken confit served the bucatini moist tender lacked flavor; In't taste the chili all; night alpine cheese good I would liked . I respect the desire let the fresh pasta shine it . I feel like dish could been dressed a tad really made impression . I won't trek back to visit; if find in bushwick want a nice night date spot is comfortable and not *too* hard on the pocketbook I would say give a try.,3.0 star rating

I also mention all pasta hand made.We the dry aged duck the pork chop special for the entree . Again; dish great; the duck definitely my favorite . I'd chosen go back eating meat just prior this meal; so my opinion might a bit inflated bc I've missed meat much; my boyfriend seemed agree! The foie gras duck covered a pasty orange glaze (cara cara) wa sweet . The pork chop were served veggie strawberry the side . The meat + strawberry combo incredible.To finish we had the chocolate olive oil cake served caramel sauce vanilla ice cream . I could've had four slice; happily.What a great meal .

5812,57,I'd heard mixed thing restaurant; decided give go group 4 relatively hungry guy . The Good: standout dish gnocchi; devoured . It decent size great sharing . The pasta pretty good . The Bad: started four appetizer - carrot; pig head; lamb tartare kampachi - priced $14- $18 per plate . We found portion size offensively small; especially carrot . At $14; came 2 silver carrot dollop carrot puree . The apps ok - I honetsly looking bit flavor lamb tartare; a bit dry bland . The Ugly: pasta a good size; were still ravenous given starter; high hope entree . We ordered duck; strip the scallop explicitly asked waiter see could make sure dish came 4 piece everyone could easily try share . Given they encouraged sharing; we thought a reasonable request they could accommodate . We expected level feedback our waiter our request; our entree came each one had three piece our group four . For a restaurant is attempting maintain a high level service for the price we paid; we found this to quite disappointing . All that being said; the duck wa a bit fatty; tasty; the streak wa fine the scallop wa quite good . Unless they take a different approach to the menu; I probably won't be running back . There a lot other option better (and more) food the or lower price point.,2.0 star rating
5813,57,Went on Saturday night a recommendation a friend; girlfriend I left thoroughly disappointed.We sat bar; had placed order; waiter/bartender come back u 15 minute later saying forgot put order .

5816,57,Not big fan Italian cuisine; I somehow deeply enjoyed meal Faro; small Italian bistro opened Kevin Adey; renown chef horned skillset both Alinea Le Barnardin . Faro certainly unique - pasta handmade Kevin; later got combined the secret sauce only genius could think . People like; usually dislike carb-heavy type food; ha surprisingly discovered I enjoyed every single course . It extremely hard pick my favorite one; be honest . Candele pork; hmm delicious; Cecamaritti lobster; loved; Caramelle; candy bar shaped pasta; sausage secretly hidden inside; nothing unbeatable! Cocktail perfectly designed lady - fruity; bit the sweet side; definitely refreshing . Kindly note tasting menu only served two seating week; Fri Sat 8pm; the counter front the open kitchen.,5.0 star rating
5817,57,4.5 star . Compared my favorite pasta restaurant Nicandras; Faro a much larger selection menu changed frequently . The price higher end; way high neighborhood my opinion . Food wise; texture the pasta spot on the flavor quite bold and rich . The dessert also decent . Overall quite satisfying . Just wish the portion could a bit bigger,4.0 star rating
5818,57,I really wanted love place just OK . The good: pasta delicious you taste fresh it . It's firm; dough-y clearly hand made . The price point great - plenty dish $25 . The bad: The pasta sauce overall dish; unimaginative underwhelming . The Bucatini bland . It tasted like pasta chicken broth smattering cheese . The cheese so minimal you quickly lose sight it taste . I felt like I eating straight pasta sauce so light . The chicken also particularly tender seasoned . Not bad definitely something would leave much an impression.The Squid Ink Frascatelli standout . The braised octopus well prepared served whole . The pasta lovely the squid ink sauce uniquely prepared . Not sure I'd suggest anyone go dish alone I'd order one . It an appetizer portion; however . The Rigatoni (I think's the one...whichever the lamb ragu) super meat intensive . There very little balance the dish . I would liked enjoy the sauce pasta well they overpowered the lamb.The Scallops good exactly you'd expect find at several dozen nice restaurant . The server attentive the hostess kind enough sit u little earlier 8:00pm reservation . I asked our main server recs hesitant highlight signature dish . When pressed he said the Bucatini is the house favorite . Not sure dish (e) pulled this Michelin star; In't them . Overall: this is great neighborhood place have a casual date night meal get together a friend . The food is a destination and of itself . I'd look elsewhere a special evening.,4.0 star rating
5819,57,Amazing food service go along it . The pasta fresh; delicious had right amount sauce . Novel dish yummy could decide one liked the most . The lamb tartare scrumptious the cavellini incredible the sauce were so good . Great find will be disappointed the food service . Enjoy!,5.0 star rating
5820,57,**** theren't 3.5 button I'm generous . The portion smaller side; I think increasing by 15% would feel much satisfying customer . Went Tuesday evening dinner placen't crowded . Atmosphere casual . The true 4 star service food get 3 star me . Wait staff attentive; definitely appreciated . Appetizers dessert go about $10ish; while entree range $22 $30.-Crudo: They ran mackerel they replace Hamachi me . Ingredients very fresh; tad bit sour taste very refreshing.-Squid Ink Pasta: very flavorful; pasta perfectly cooked; come a generous portion lobster . -Bucatini: lack flavor In't a fan the texture the chicken the sauce . -Scallops: Excellent! Highly recommend the scallop . come with 3 hugeee scallop's seared perfectly . Flavor profile point.-Chocolate Olive Oil Cake: I really wanted like; In't . I say I not a fan salted caramel though; the sauce is a light caramel sauce there's salt top the ice cream (gross me). With these strong flavor going; I did not taste the olive oil top of the chocolate cake would impact the flavor . The cake is also on the mediocre side.,4.0 star rating

5823,57,All Show NO Go . This place claim fancy want be elegant their fancy menu's ingredient . Well; I wish I knew begin . I'll break down keep simple: Atmosphere: Hipster environment absolutely elegance ever place . I feel like I'm low end pizza joint wooden table seat . Kitchen front when cook food wrong's terrible - can stare you . How elegant?! Right? NOT! Service: Waitress rude I'll-mannered . The waitress upset we asking question what certain word meant menu . I've gone 5 Star Restaurants 3 Star Michelin - never word like a menu then food taste like rubber tasteless garbage (; all!). Bus Girls Boys tentative well mannered . Wine always filled so water . Plates were cleared quickly . Food: I'll start good . The steak au jus tasty . The $6 per loaf bread tasty nothing I couldn't get free elsewhere . The bad: I asked steak be medium rare - came raw rare . Waitress told rare instead agreeing customer - fatal mistake . Everyone table agreed rare . Sent back it came better (still a tad rare.). They gave 3 small slice steak; 3 measly hard raw potato the size a thumb radish had reason be on my plate in the first place . A whopping $27 a mediocre steak cooked wrong . Nice job guy! The salmon undercooked . The salmon lacked flavor also so small they have charged half the price . Had send back well . Pasta okay nothing like home . Wine average overpriced - nothing new . The appetizer were so displeasing look I couldn't bare try . I'll leave it . I knew place wan't elegant at prime they waitressn't even stand next to cut my steak . A fraud uncovered! Also took hour+ the main dish a good 30/45 minute appetizer . Verdict: Brooklyn lot hidden gem; this placen't one them . The Rude waitress killed the mood; the food wa mediocre at best; and the idea being fancy the menun't make it taste better! $400+ mush . It kill inside we spent that much - guilt I could have given it to charity . Won't be back and they paid me to - I would still decline.,1.0 star rating

Those still the menu'll currently find Faro's website.As entree; are the same well . We went Wood Fired Chicken roasted garlic; potato puree; argula then the Black Bass potato; ramp fumet; nasturtium . Both fantastic; put on list.Above all else though; should here the pasta .

Highly recommend going group you try big selection dish! A quick breakdown what expect season: Summer: The highlight summer meal always feature signature handmade pasta super-fresh farmer market ingredient . It's great share few pasta the table; you expect outstanding summery main course like roasted veal fresh fig; pan seared scallop; (you're lucky) pole-caught fish the chef himself.Autumn: As the weather turn cooler; Faro becomes super cozy place spend evening turn the wood-fired oven the open kitchen . That oven where they bake incredible bread made hand-milled grain then serve hot homemade cultured butter (YUM). One the memorable meal had Faro pre-Thanksgiving dinner en route the airport featured a perfectly roasted family-style chicken buttery heirloom German potato; mushroom porridge; a simply-dressed kale salad.Winter: The restaurant really come alive in the dark winter month; it white wood Scandinavian-simple interior blazing hearth fire . Expect filling pasta; porridge; hearty root vegetable side . Plus the chef introduced a 8-course tasting menu year new dish every week . When went; enjoyed black truffle pommes dauphine; sunchoke rigatoni; saffron scallop corzetti; shortrib culingioni dumpling; marrow bean gnudi.Spring: Faro's menu continues offer many their signature pasta; also change over to lighter option like beautifully composed salad feature tender early-season veggie like heirloom beet radish; green strawberry; fresh lavender yogurt . Spring pea; edible flower; baby veggie adorn the beautiful plate main LOVED included roasted octopus; tenderloin; lamb.Also worth recommending the consistently great cocktail wine list Chef Adey's wife front house manager Deb put together .

Now although I admittedly got small fraction establishment listed many``best 2015""list swirling around NYC Zeitgeist usual time year; I hard pressed think another new place I enjoyed singularly thoroughly; couldn't wait return much one . I could say utmost confidence my favorite new restaurant open borough this year; perhaps longer . Perhaps due large part my Long Island root; I sucker thing pasta; true name; this place treat starch utmost reverence showcase myriad ever changing shape flavor beautifully . The first time I instantly hooked delicious parley infused cavattelli tossed a pork seamlessly blended beyond recognition a delicious smokey creamy fresh ricotta . I back soon others; more better sample various rotating offering . Some standout pasta wildly inventive; like said cavatelli; well a softer usual bucatini served an alpine cheese pasteurized chicken (only pasta I seen continuously offered every visit) a rye pasta seemed a homage German spaetzle paired braised beef cartelized onion; a thick rigatoni an west indian inspired Goat ragu kale pistachio . Other pasta; no le delicious marvel simplicity; like another rigatoni served well cooked onion pancetta; a perfectly executed cacio e pepe would surely past muster whatever part Italy dish hail . While In't think I could ever come order pasta; non pasta offering have proved be uniformly excellent well; including a inspired pairing breathes new life two all too ubiquitous mainstay New American cooking; pork belly cornbread; a chicken cacciatore based around juiciest chicken I remember served quite time . The excellence the food is matched the professionalism the staff; the impressive yet minimalist setting; a loft space fashioned a former MOMA storage faculty is in keeping with the aesthetic the surrounding neighborhood symbolic inevitable progression towards full grown-up status . Looking around the dining room; admiring the talented kitchen staff working in the open kitchen centered around the gorgeous wood burning oven; it impossible not notice the wide range age um;``type``patron dining; and think even a year two ago would be the party pretty unlikely to find in precinct; reserved for the most hipster hipster .

The cocktail also; good.The downside; maybe I known better we came; portion extremely small; literally everything . We ordered whole wheat bread ($ 6) beet start . Our group 5 couldn't even split bread it size a bulky roll cut 4 tiny piece . I able eat one 3mm thick beet slice a nut tiny bit garnish (I think the beet around $14). The flavor great; it seemed like little the price (at least should told u we would better getting two everything). The pasta I had a main extremely good (Talare di Suore; is akin ravioli). But; very small portion I still hungry I finished . My sister got the gnocchi; wan't really gnocchi (what would think a gnocchi without other explanation the menu) more like a potato/bready casserole .

My fault assuming squid ink based sauce rather squid ink pasta dough; either way I felt like wa flavorful enough . However; lobster in dish wa cooked perfectly . Portion seemed small side average diner.- The vanilla panna cotta dessert surprisingly immense; given usual dessert size well restaurant's serving size; explains the price tag . These great definitely for sharing--the streak dark chocolate substantial; though; since's the combination make it so good.-Even though the style/prices of this restaurantn't casual; the dress code ambiance definitely is; is fine may be surprsing . Despite the Michelin star ;n't expect a Michelin atmosphere.,4.0 star rating

It tasted like someone threw the pasta then added very dry overcooked death meat . My partner got the Squid Ink Strozzapreti wa tasty . I'm guessing wa prepared someone else .

Unfortunately; the foodn't the same level either! The Squid Ink pasta meh the Tortelloni (I last time) also meh . It a though whoever cooked the dish second timen't care .

Purely based my expectation toward regular duck breast; the duck job well done . Probably one the best I've ever had.Drink: We their draft hard cider (Bad Seed); metropolitan lager (Flagship). Both pretty good fit taste . Hard cider crispy sweet . My wife love it . Lager light a bit bitter note strong . Just I like it . :) The Catch: The food portion not big a regular size man like would probably need a full three course just be enough . The price range definitely not $11 - 30 .

We reservation 8PM got there around 7:50 . We seated immediately we water within minute; minute later server there see we wanted drink let u know special . We got bread start--small house made wheat loaf cultured butter . It came very warm delicious . I could eat bread every day . I decided bucatini; my friend got rigatoni . I really tempted chicken ;n't sure I hungry enough also; server said pasta real star the menu . I excited upon hearing . I lived Italy little ate fresh pasta regularly . I love pasta.When the food came looked beautiful . We'd noticed either side u the dish came looking like art . Some the plate pretty I'm sure I'd able eat--Ha . I'd totally able eat without taking a pic posting on instagram . The rigatoni delicious; the braised goat came with tender flavorful . It a rich hearty dish managed heavy . My bucatini good; also a much smalller portion--would been nice the server mention . I notice set the traditional Italian style the pasta a first course; it clear some the pasta course larger the others . The issue I the pasta a little al dente I would liked . When pasta cooked correctly it's soft on the outside then there a bit chew the middle but it's still cooked . This pasta still completely white most it so instead having a a nice firm texture it wa basically raw the middle . For the pasta to be the star the menu; for it to be cooked properly conversely not be that exciting (least the case my bucatini); I wa let down.In't send it back I wa starving In't want send it back then get cooked pasta return .

5900,57,Faro everything ought expect New York; whether local tourist . Chef-owner Kevin Adey kind chef mind never stop turning . From restaurant's original conceit--Adey milling own wheat housemade pasta--flowed dazzling; flavorful array pasta sensation; better last . He serf bright; spacious room harmless gritty-looking block Jefferson Street (take note; tourist); attentive casual hospitality welcoming appropriate neighborhood . Like previous spot; Northeast Kingdom; Faro focused local seasonal ingredient; useful corny way . The sweet pea porridge springtime bowl (early summer; matter). Summer pasta soar lightness ;n't miss gnocchi; weirdly deliciously reminiscent grilled cheese sandwich . At the top the menu'll see bread order ;n't bitch not getting free bread basket just order . They make few loaf a day; it's phenomenal . Whatever ate probably won't the menu anymore the time go --'s a good thing . Don't concerned; though--whatever Adey whip sure be a winner.Of course; Faro's cocktail menu concise strong; almost equally course; wine list contains a number value unusual find (the Zinfandel/Tempranillo a don't-miss). Faro; ; the perfect restaurant New York not just it excellent; because execution so perfectly a reflection it location--in term what's on the plate; the real estate . It is a beacon in a fast-changing neighborhood; probably JeffTown's first true destination restaurant (apology Northeast Kingdom). This city is lousy good great Italian restaurant; none quite like Faro . A small practical note: Be aware that the portion size the pasta vary somewhat considerably . If that's a concern you; ask.,5.0 star rating

We finished our meal the beignet - yum!! The meat flavorful smokey . Usually; I would avoid goat of's gameyness; the smoking curry balance the flavor . I not sure I liked; the rib the brisket .

We went tried devil egg $5; only give one egg's cut half with pickled rhubarb herb . The egg cold if taken fridge . I felt could at least warm it up bit serving it . We also their pickled jarred veggie terrible . There some awful taste smell it have served garnish rather an appetizer . For main dish; then ordered their smoked goat neck with curry/cherry rice . We excited dish once; a bit of a disappointment . The meat no flavor just mushy all around . As the rice; I not taste curry flavor it wa super oily that I barely even touched dish .

5912,58,Ducks Eatery absolutely hidden gem!! A tapa place never wannamissed.Location: Place both indoor outdoor area dining . I would say indoor dining area very romantic whereas outdoor dining area absolutely chill fun; especially summer time . We reservation actually visiting . Even though late; waitress nice enough keep our seat another 30 min . Food: We there right happy hour (ended 7??? 7:30???) Alcohol pretty cheap that moment course could skip cheap deal . Also; three u basically ordered everything their menu everything tasted fabulous . We love their oak BBQ; fried artichoke; chicken wing!! Beignets something you should never skipped all the great food.Service: Seems bit disorganized such small area . We trying order another round of wine it hard get waitress/waiter's attention all . They were quite busying greeting potential customer...Price: $$ most 30/person.Overall: Good; I would recommend visit happy hour - plenty drink; great tapa; not-so-effcient service .

5913,58,I've dying go Ducks quite time; any well-received; New Orleans-influenced location pique interest . Happily; almost everything lived expectation . Generous happy hour ($ 3 genesee; $5 wine a $6 specialty cocktail). The cheap booze paired nicely a shared small plate (salted cucumber appetizer particularly inventive refreshing) excellent; nicely-spiced rice bean chunk lamb dinner . Service incredibly quick friendly; even a quite crowded restaurant . Unfortunately; one disappointing mark thing I most looking forward; ordered light save room--dessert . The beignet soft outside; chewy dense inside--complete opposite the texture I'd expect some glorious fried dough . And the chocolate espresso dipping sauce an odd flavor paired poorly . In't expecting du Monde;...need be revisited replaced . Maybe some chocolate praline a king cake you want to keep the Big Easy connection.,4.0 star rating

Instead orange juice; use calamansi juice . I ordered Benedict de Marie Laveau; come sourdough bread creole hollandaise ham . The hollandaise tasted spectacular; I wish bread wa easier cut .

On the other hand; the goat neck super tasty come top a bed fragrant rice . I love herb; I appreciated the huge handful cilantro top the neck .

Ducksn't large space; two small table center rest table wall around . So busy night; I imagine's hard walk . However; came on Monday evening it manageable . The server super nice came helpful recommendation . She patient; attentive; welcoming Gilt City voucher; yet aggressive all . For drink tried Kataja; a gin-based drink celery; juniper; lemon; the Duck Buck; bourbon; ginger; calamansi (a type citirus fruit); soda . The cocktail nothing write home; they alright . Onto the food: We started the Pickle Jar - included pickled jicama; okra baby carrot . Followed the Celery Root Fried Artichoke vegetable plate . Both vegetable were sizeable portion were truly decadent . Admittedly; the pickle jar whet our appetite the star the evening: the vegetable the meat dish . Speaking....the meat: Chicken Wings . Now; only get 4 full wing; they filling full of flavor . So good; worth every bite! We finished everything Smoked Pot de Creme; made with chocolate; chili; salted caramel whipped cream . I mean; I would've licked the jar....Definitely a great experience overall and would go back.,4.0 star rating

5970,59,Clay pot rice! Cute; small; cozy place; tucked away . The best cold days.Place clean; service attentive . Food great; portion size perfect (may find small). Value great . What clay pot? Simple instruction sit table viewing - pick topping your rice; add sauce; dig . Ifn't tried before ;'re definitely missing out.The beauty clay pot rice rice cooked fresh clay pot . As rice cool; edge harden get delightfully crispy; chewy outer layer . Delicious.My topping: Chinese sausage; chicken . Comes bit vegetable tofu.Because clay pot rice; much flavor come topping . The rice is decent; not spectacular; there's bit pressure restaurant deliver good toppings.I get the Chinese sausage . I love; always love . This no different . Both savory sweet . A little greasy ;'s just how always is . Chicken tenderly cooked; soft; could've more flavorful . The vegetable little disappointing; little bland . The tofu far dry dull.The rice is pretty dry already; especially's cooked a claypot . It becomes even drier the edge harden . I hoping the topping would help balance this dryness; wa left a little short . They; however; have two house sauce - one's similar soy sauce (slightly sweeter); another one's thicker sweet (almost like eel sauce not quite extent). I enjoyed sauce; really liked the thicker sauce . Sweet salty - potent flavoring . There a other topping - ginger; etc . Using the sauce help moisten your food give more a punch . However; the topping weren't flavorful; you end eating sauced rice; chicken the side . Ideally though; part would equally important would complement each other make a delicious whole . I enjoyed Clay Pot; would definitely go back second . Side note: need use some strength really scrape that chewy outer layer rice of the clay pot . Hard scrape chopstick . But the spoon provided edge that were too rough me to grip properly without it hurting hand.,4.0 star rating

5979,59,Food : 3.5/5Atmosphere : 3.5/5Service : 4/5Overall : 3.5/5I ordered clay pot 2 topping: pork belly Chinese sausage . All pot come egg; veggie; corn well . The pot came after 10 minute; ready eat . The staff also provided House sauce adjust flavor taste; regular soy well garlic also available tables.I honestly high hope I walked; clay pot rice one my favorite casual Cantonese dish . I bit disappointed rice used . The Clay Pot use long grain rice; would take longer cook is actually make difference taste the clay pot rice dish . The restaurant used something looked like minute rice...the grain lacked structure did hold shape . The rice make a difference not only the aroma the dish; also how easily becomes guoba (the burnt rice the bottom of the pan).I would still come back though; it a pretty good value a well balanced meal . Hopefully use the real clay pot rice next time.,3.0 star rating

5982,59,When I saw Clay Pot NYC opening East Village; I very excited seeing Fung Bros. cover YouTube blew my expectation . Sadly; I little disappointed . It a good clay pot rice place; something off.- The location far St. Marks shop liveliness . It took a while find get to.- The menu very Noob-friendly . It teach how order how eat it.- There two sauce table: special soy sauce the special ginger sauce . I hate ginger . Note self-n't touch the ginger sauce next time.- You pick topping what would like in your clay pot . There no classic a the chicken mushroom clay pot the Lap Mei clay pot (although can choose Chinese sausage your topping).- The chicken beef slice the topping very reminiscent Western cut meat tossed Chinese takeout broccoli . - The crunchy rice on the bottom very satisfying.- The pan-seared prawn appetizer die; wa flavorful juicy . A must try . Overall; place make clay pot accessible to newcomer; I feel a bit lacking the traditionalist.,3.0 star rating

5986,59,Check Yelp Facebook get free app deal (waitress told u since it's posted). Very limited bar seating we sit outside Friday night . Service great food came pretty fast . The open kitchen pretty efficient it meant ricen't cooked ingredient together; flavor not soak rice . We got 2 item; sausage (savory sweet); chicken (bland white meat); eel (tender) shrimp . The oyster sauce on top needed flavor the rice; did crisp bottom layer you to scrape . Be sure to add the ginger onion sauce to balance the fattiness.It's worth getting a side veggie . We also the scallop appetizer; wa a bit salty well flavored green onion.,4.0 star rating

5989,59,Disclaimer meal comped part promotion; food so good craving I come back it.I got mine shrimp; veggie; Chinese sausage; particularly excited last part; Chinese sausage rather hard find restaurant around . All pot come spinach; corn; marinated hard boiled egg; crispy tofu . If order veggie a topping; will simply get double amount spinach; corn; egg; tofu . Our waiter brought three type sauce mix our clay pot - light soy; sweet soy; spicy soy; along a ginger scallion relish . I think sauce make dish; if go heavy the sauce; will an easier time scraping the socarrat (fan jiao according the menu) the pot the end . The best bite would a mixture the rice; spinach; egg; tofu doused that thick sweet soy sauce . I practically inhaled my meal; every bite reminds me home . In't actually think the protein choice that important; In't care the sausage I found soft the shrimp; the overall flavor of the bowl so satisfying nonetheless.We came Sunday prime dinner time the space a good crowd no one wait . You have wait a bit your clay pot to be ready; the restaurant offer interesting soft beverage China small plate you wait.,4.0 star rating

5996,59,The long awaited Clay Pot NYC finally! The restaurant situated middle residential block St. Marks East Village . I really excited looking forward opening really no restaurant NYC specializes clay pot rice (Bao Zai Fan)! There might restaurant Chinatown Brooklyn Chinatown imitation clay pot rice menu it not same! The process preparing cooking clay pot take time like art form.Inside; space pretty narrow small . There's maybe enough seat 22 guest time . My friend I front house; counter-seating; right behind kitchen all action! It pretty cool able see whole cooking process take place right eye . The menu simple straightforward . Every order come staple rice; egg; spinach; tofu corn get choice 2 topping; include eel; chicken; beef; pork belly; veggie; Chinese sausage baby shrimp . There's also small plate available like seared prawn; scallop squid; these enjoy waiting clay pot rice cook . For additional flavoring ;'s also bottle soy sauce sriracha each table . I chose pork belly Chinese sausage my topping . Our main took awhile cook; 15 minute; average clay pot rice cook properly . In meantime; tried order seared squid; delicious! It cooked perfectly; nice chew without rubbery seasoning point! The clay pot rice cooked very well . The crispy rice bottom pot perfectly nailed! To eat properly; really mix everything together . Also; make sure you dig bottom mix rice all other ingredient; you leave rice long ;'ll burn cuz rice still cooking heat gathered clay pot . I thought the pork belly a little bland; I added soy sauce extra flavoring . It may imagining thing; I thought soy saucen't your standard soy sauce any supermarket..I thought maybe the flavor altered a bit somehow? Maybe? Lol O_o Anyways; the soy sauce definitely help add flavor the dish overall . This is a great start the restaurant; lot promise successful! There a few thing I would suggest the owner; my friend I noticed our visit: For example; the moment sat ordered; when actually got our food; the wait time wa 15-20 minute . Most people are unfamiliar the clay pot rice is would be impatient start complaining . Maybe would be a good idea have tutorial the wall the back the menu; on the history clay pot rice properly eat the dish . A comic strip tutorial on how eat clay pot rice the old school way might work too..similar how Chinese restaurant instruct their guest how use chopstick . Perhaps; even have the manager waitstaff walk around make sure guest know to . Also; noticed towards the end our stay; wa a decent line the door . I imagine would be the norm Fridays weekend . You guy show the guest waiting outside the menu; take order give number receipt once're inside seated; the food be about ready to be served . Just observation suggestions..lol Overall; this wa awesome experience! My friend I have been waiting Clay Pot NYC to open for a long time; we're glad it finally! This spot ha lot potential to be a success . Huge shout to the owner Alex Chris and the whole team there!: D,4.0 star rating

Pork Belly Chicken Clay PotI would say compared other clay pot dish I've eaten; clay pot fall short execution . I like support local business; I going offer advice:1 . Flavor - rice need depth flavor . I felt these dishn't have need have soy sauce hot sauce added . I would suggest incorporating protein leach flavor the rice cooked; a beef cake spare rib . 2 . Veggies - I feel like the dish skimped spinach; corn (missing) tofu . The tofu square the size a unifix cube . 3 . Cooking - In't mind crispy rice; shouldn't is burnt rice . I feel like customern't told mix the rice; they would end eating ash . I know I came during's infancy; however I would stick to grabbing clay pot dish Chinatown . I understand what the owner Clay Pot attempting applaud effort; until the dish achieve authentic feel; I left eating elsewhere on the block.,3.0 star rating

There variation vegetable; tofu; the protein your choice my case the chinese sausage baby shrimp . The rice portion gave I thought a bit much (In't normally eat a lot) everything else felt right . The bottom wan't overcooked still the crispy piece I loved much I stole of my friend' . Perhaps's because I eat pretty healthy In't think the rice needed additional flavour they provide condiment soy sauce sriracha a add ons . Overall; I would definitely return Clay Pot even I wan't around the area . I hope to see expanded menu in the future it's officially open what's currently offered perfect those get overwhelmed too many choice . Give everything this menu a try; especially the PRAWNS . Even if you end just getting the veggie clay pot; you must order the prawn! No regret!,5.0 star rating

The shell well crispy seasoned sauce come taste like home . I very impressed not expecting . 4/5 clay pot! I loved straight forward menu . I eel Chinese sausage both protein good well seasoned . Once again; I applaud well made rice at the bottom the bowl . The ricen't seasoned than the topping come; I actually prefer . They the sauce sriacha make salty a bland a you want . I recommend adding the sauce mixing in; give the edge couple minute harden up before peeling from the bowl . Then mix the whole thing you've got good texture every bite!! If you're worried t too burnt you can always scrape off right the bowl come . I probably waited a good 10 minutes.Overall great place fill rice craving; perfect place bring date you want Chinese Chinese food!! And finally; GET THE PRAWNS .

The meat were well prepared the rice portion were hearty.However; there any criticism it come the food it would in regard the flavor the rice . Each table come bottle soy sauce sriracha; I found relying these topping give the rice flavor often I'd like to have .

The shop definitely take time do clay pot rice the right way . It came with crispy rice the bottom; not burnt . The topping not the traditional one decent (traditional one won't corn; broccoli fried tofu). The Chinese sausage are a little disappointing there wa really aroma aged dried meat .

Each rice come egg; spinach; corn dried tofu selection two protein . The conceptn't work me there nothing bringing these element together . The chicken pork belly super dry lean . Eel chinese sausage were ok . Itn't seem like they know to use salt . The whole claypot bland tasteless - I added so much soy sauce still nothing . I even tried adding the ginger sauce that didn't work either . In the end; I couldn't even finish my claypot . TLDR worth the wait; Americanized; still hungry unsatisfied; will be back.,2.0 star rating

They sat down even though husbandn't there yet; wa nice.FOOD: They serve claypot rice; a popular Chinese dish rice the bottom; veggie meat top cooked a clay pot . The bottom the rice becomes crispy all the flavor is soaked onto the rice cook the meat veggies.For $12 choose 2 topping . It come white rice the bottom veggie already unless you vegetarian I would say order double meat theyn't give you much . The beef come 3 slice is a bit tough -'s regular beef .

When the claypot come (take a while cook don't expect come quickly; I think took 10+ minute); they pour soy sauce to help cook even .

I mean wa all lean meat resulted extremely dry my opinion completely unsatisfying . It wa hard find the piece eel in my pot mixing it; I assumen't very generous the portion but nevertheless; whenever I find piece it wa delicious . The beef great.. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS . Separately; I love how the rice around the bowl crispy (a it be); got this part correct! However; it wa a bit burnt I problem chewing the rice the protein rice/sauce proportion were a little underwhelming .

There simply insane amount choice one to choose . The night went; group got the pork belly (tender really fatty); udon (light well balanced); sashimi sampler (fresh melt in your mouth good); grilled eggplant 3 different sauce (perfectly grilled) well slice beef cooked a hot stone (intensely good).Food nothing short top notch . Quality ingredient first class . Service decent albeit a tad slow get hectic . Only reason I can't give it 5 star is the value .

The placen't busy I went Thursday evening I noticed most table reserved's unlikely they room walk-in (though restaurant so hard find I doubt anyone would ever stumble upon).We tried signature dish including Sashimi Moriawase; Buta Kakuni (braised pork belly); Unisoba.The sashimi very fresh I loved included uni at $60 15 piece; it seemed a bit pricey taste . The pork belly not bad; not impressive either . The unisoba probably most unique dish of presentation broth . We also tried the Tori Karaage wa also good not amazing - probably the best dish the price.Overall; it wa a good place try none of the dish particularly grabbed my attention I wouldn't back anytime soon.,3.0 star rating

Kind hard time separating noodle I dip in sauce . And sashimi rice okay...I wish a little bit sashimi; wa left a lot rice bottom.The fruit sake wa pretty good though! Ordered tasting one.. believe wa $10 you choose have 4 of the 5 listed . Got the plum; peach; strawberry; citrus flavor.. were so good! With the food though..maybe I'll come another time order something else.,3.0 star rating
6082,60,Loved torus karaage; greasy all . Buta kakuni tasted good waaay much fat . Unisoba actually kinda disappointing the soba noodle tasted like plain noodle . We also tried daily special beef; wa really average quality wagyu beef you buy any Japanese supermarket; 8 small piece $40? I think it's bit overpriced.,3.0 star rating
6083,60,"This place one hidden gem NYC good circle . It's located basement building; getting lost first-timers acceptable . It``in-Japan""kinda vibe enter . Reservations only available 6 people up . Check website party below 6 . The bathroom amazed since's discretely designed may think's big wooden keg near entrance surrounded sandbag; the likeness those people used WWII . It neat organize . Staff friendly courteous . They always speak me Japanese; like I but I'm . Ha! Food great I believe the flavor ooze you sip sake glass . Washu beef my favorite; cooked top hot stone . It's insane! If you have good group know balance great conversation when use phone; night memorable one . We crazy loud (urusai). Yes! I see a lady her 7-y/o daughter a sake bar keep side-eyeing u due to our passionate interaction each . Who brings a kid a bar?! Message to that mom: Create interesting convo; engage your daughter (not be here); you won't even notice the people around you regardless their level loudness . NY public library a good option you . Ha! I digress . My apology . Overall- food great; ambience awesome; the staff hands-down respectful the location like finding a needle a haystack; is worth it!",4.0 star rating
6084,60,This place...expensive . If're coming looking grab bite maybe splurge $50 buck; should coming . Also ;'s underground don't be surprised no reception.I got: WASHU BEEF TATAKI (beef sashimi); BUTA KAKUNI (pork belly); UNISOBA (noodle uni); GINDARA YUAN YAKI (cod).The beef sashimi basically thin slice rare beef . It's definitely marinated something salty (ponzu soy sauce) then's daikon balance saltiness . I actuallyn't think much dish . The beef good (great) quality fact you many sharp flavor beef signifies youn't focusing quality the beef . Would pas this even though's signature dish.The pork belly my favorite . The ratio roughly 50/50 fat meat . It's hard make pork belly taste good though....and you get 1 large piece serving . The meet very tender you cut spoon; tender fall piece (good!). Sometimes you eat pork belly just feel fatty ;n't the case . The sauce/oil it came made get bowl rice I could consume it without looking disgusting it delicious; too fatty salty.The cod two piece very well cooked . The piece tender the flavoring the more subtle side focusing on the fish IMO . I prefer dish have a glaze them be a bit sweeter . It good cod; probably not worth the price.The noodle pretty good I liked it combined small tempura batter . Always love crispy item my dish . However; piece quickly become squishy the soup so make sure eat it fast! The uni came it seemed be pretty low tier uni I pretty disappointed that . So you a huge fan uni; this will disappoint.Overall; place is pretty expensive . Spent 90/person.,3.0 star rating
6085,60,What let! Not great vegetarian . They a vegetarian menu's great; real hot dish either.Shishito peppers- were steamed! No flavoring all . For first time a I ask waiter bring salt . Eggplant: good flavoring bitter . I also asked waiter hot water lemon it took about 10-15 minute to bring it . The ambiance nice . Location great . In't think it's off night though . The waitern't seemed phased I mentioned the flavor lacking.,3.0 star rating
6086,60,After work Japanese eat drink place near work place . I've here more five time . It's good friend gathering . The restaurant located downstairs (bad thing there's cell phone signal lol).

It look like thing get their lunch special; came DINNER; here go--This a small plate style restaurant . We ordered 6 the two u since the waiter said 2 our dish meant 'one' person . There some HIGH's very low's..Favorites: - uni; ikura; poached egg a cold dashi broth (Uni Ikura Onsen Tamago): beautifully presented delicious . fave the night- pork belly (buta kakuni): one their popular dish . A square slow cooked pork belly melt your mouth! I would've liked In't full the rest our meal . This dish came last- grilled pike mackerel onigiri (Yaki Sanma onigiri): Our waiter warned u``fishy ;""isn't fishier regular grilled mackerel! So good!! I highly recommend onigiri . The fish rice ratio is perfect- black sesame creme brulee: PERFECT end our meal . It's served a scoop black sesame ice cream well . I thought $14 wa a bit much a dessert; once we (more like I) devoured; I felt it wa justified.PASS: - ebi stick: thanks . shrimp wrapped nori wrapped eggroll wrapper fried . Nothing special- grilled black cod (Gindara Yuan Yaki): wayyy salty . Some part the fish also overcooked- chopped raw octopus: not like at allThey an extensive menu; so it's hard pick choose your first visit . But I would definitely order the 4 dish listed again I come back! P.S . have the best match!!! Don't forget one on your way",4.0 star rating

Fellow diner I shared following dish: -Sashimi Moriwase ($ 60) three piece uni; amberjack; tuna; scallop; one left In't remember .

I hoped fish more tender/smooth meaty/dry.-Buta Kakuni ($ 7) braised pork belly served a spoon really tender . On level the black cod; meaty very tender pork a sweet soy.And the show stopper of the night; the black sesame creme brulee ($ 14) incredibly expensive exceedingly delicious black sesame hitting every taste bud cool; creamy; crispy; toffee like texture exploding your mouth.Service pretty good; got forgotten near the end of the night wa glad waiter knew bring the bill without u having ask . He spoke very fast; remembered every order; provided great recommendation . Monday night yielded wait .

They were really well balanced one wa perfect our fried food option; the wa good around . The item we picked dinner: UZAKU - fresh eel; not entirely memorableKAMO ROAST NEGIMAKI - good highlight the night; meant one person reallyAGEDASHI TOFU - In't know tofu could taste SO good! Again; not meant sharing at $8.50; I would try elsewhereTORI KARAAGE & KUROBUTA KARAAGE - I liked the chicken better the pork; thought wa really worth a a stand alone maybe sharing one person . However; with the amount karaage place NYC; wouldn't the place try the first time because you're going to have high expectationsTORI TSUKUNE - hubby's personal favorite that we ordered it twice; really a good safe choice crowd pleaserSALMON CHIRASHI - hurt for $26 . It wa good; again; you can get wayyyy cheaper elsewhereWith dessert; each u got something different; everything came to $350+ for four of u .

I specifically went Thursday barachirashi; ; like other special; come a hot cold soba (waitress recommended cold; even though cold outside). While the lunch special $12 may seem like a good deal; I unenthused the offering . The soba wa good; even the dipping sauce; plain . Overall the barachirashi included only a small portion sashimi not enough satiate appetite . Even the sushi rice could been warmer softer .

We a tiny bit difficulty finding place (is basement an office building);n't hard especially all yelp tip try help locate restaurant! We started Maguro Tartar Gindara Yuan Yaki - Tartar a bit bland I expected a yuzu flavor; roe cucumber added texture freshness dish . The Gindara Yuan Yaki delicious the fish beautifully cooked; however the soy sauce just a tad overpowering salty . Our main the Nihachi Soba Cold Inaniwa Udon - soba pretty ordinary; nothing special . However the Udon incredible - the texture the noodle; the poached egg; the citrus soy base - everything came together I LOVED .

6117,60,Sakagura kind place come you're Japanophile/recently returned trip miss food/love soba noodle . Though's certainly all're known . I'd heard good thing this place; friend I came weekday lunch Friday . The restaurant busy; staff exhibited traditional Japanese hospitality; took care u soon came . We took seat bar immediately poured glass water; given menu . There a sea urchin soba special they serve 7 bowl per day; my friend wanted order; they already sold by time ordered (around 1:30pm). Instead; decided order tuna tororo soba; the duck soba; the black miso cod . All food presented a timely fashion . The miso cod served first; cooked a sweet miso sauce perfectly accentuated the cod; which fatty; flaked away picked fork . Before we finished eating it; our bowl soba served . The tuna tororo soba wa served cold; a couple piece glistening tuna sliver nori sitting top . The noodle refreshing; a good texture- too hard; dry soft . My friend's duck soba wa served hot; a simple soy broth . The piece duck were good quality added a good meat flavor the otherwise simple noodle . All all; we were completely satisfied and full without complaint make the food; ambience; service . Prices for food are also than reasonable .

6118,60,TLDR: Extremely long wait slightly average food . A notable mention though Buta pork belly . Came around 8:30 given estimated hour long wait . So decided wait refrained going Sushi Yasuda (across street). It my boyfriend birthday abiding his jap food request . We walked around block waited until 10 pm got be too much . No call; text; nothing . So we decided go ask low behold forgot u . Which fine I get it didn't even apologize; hostess just awkwardly smiled . We got seated ordered: sashimi platter; beef tataki; buta pork belly udon- paired sake! The sashimi platter average only notable mention sea bream (seasonal special); lumberjack uni . Tataki not good at all; the udon plain . The only thing redeemed the place wa the buta pork belly . Overall 3/5 - would been 3.5 but the terrible wait time and management docked the 0.5 imo,3.0 star rating

6121,60,Was looking a really good unique restaurant near Grand Central found Sakagura (using Yelp). Amazing place amazing food . Felt like literally transported Tokyo . Note though - Definitely NOT typical sushi place . Many different plate well some staple . They their fish sashimi style - ask rice the side . Incredibly fresh sushi . (Almost good Yoji Yamada!). The sake selection insane . I believe Sakagura the largest collection sake the States . Not cheap portion not large; price were line typical NYC restaurant (2 u ate $200 including $30 sake w/o tip.). Probably best reservation . We went early (6pm) were able to slip assuming would finish 7:45 . Sorry photo - the one in the review spot.,5.0 star rating
6122,60,"Awesome find NYC I actually found quick Yelp search . This place about 5 6 block hotel Midtown pleasant walk . First thing know restaurant inside appears office building residential building . You walk main door past security desk down flight stair basement lose cell service . We arrived told that wait would be about hour they would text u our table ready . We decided head bar around corner wait . We only able 1 round then our table ready; le anticipated hour.This restaurant set tapa share your table; 4 people perfect u! Beverages evening included carafe Ichinokura Sake the table; Snow Peach Sake Cocktail (large enough share at least 2 people); several Sapporo drafts.We about 10 different dish this plenty u; may been able do without 1 2 them most good portion . They came a sporadic order the appetizer based dish first the heavier portioned item later.The Kuro Edamame; Kanpachi (Amber Jack) Sashimi A La Carte; Miso Soup what you would expect . All delicious nothing extraordinary . For cold dish ordered the Washu Beef Tataki fantastic perfectly salty.On to the fried dish; had the Shishito Age good none blistering hot . The thrill the heat gamble always favorite part those pepper that disappointing . We also had the Ebi Stick deep fried shrimp roll . These were great well the miso sauce paired great them.From the grilled dish consumed the Nasu Dengaku (grilled eggplant) Tori Tsukune (chicken meatball). These were probably favorite the dish a they were both very unique.One Sakagura's signature dish the Buta Kakuni (braised pork belly) I see . I a huge fan pork belly this right my alley . Finally; had the Hot``Inaniwa""Udon wa nice a filling (probably one those dish could have passed).Overall I wa satisfied our meal the cost wa pretty great how much ordered .

6127,60,"Sakagura came highly recommended me friend mine's studied Japan doe business lot; somehow experiencen't quite sing . Maybe I unusual experience; this place clearly popular (reservation highly recommended); nothing quite rose occasion; even taking price account.A sashimi combo bowl; consisting red snapper; sea bream; tuna; amberjack; scallop beautifully presented modestly sized; item particularly satisfying amberjack scallop . In particular; I'm sure this commonplace good sashimi and/or sushi establishment; my piece tuna were bit hard chew; upon closer examination; line what looked like connective tissue running each them.It's probably better idea get an assortment their smaller hot dish . Their``signature dish ;""buta kakuni (pork belly); a compact serving deliciously fatty; meaty; chewy goodness; complemented a pleasantly sweet sauce . Meanwhile; the torus karaage (fried chicken thigh) wa fried a bit crunchy my taste; not much to spoil the whole dish warrant sending back . Besides the food ;'re perhaps best known their encyclopedic sake selection; the entire length the bar stocked sake bottle custom sake vessel . As service; wa a transactional; remote experience lacked the genuine hospitality'd see Japan . The restaurant been around a long time therefore attracts a strong following; perhaps's gotten a bit complacent is resting it laurel much.",2.0 star rating
6128,60,Came New Years soba Soba Totto totto packed . The atmosphere Sakagura so calming me just overall enjoyable . The flower plant real beautifully arranged . Though bit pricy; good while go restaurant . No need worry oil/grease/ fattening food . Their tea they provide pleasant drink . They lunch special everyday for only $12 . Plain hot soba $10 . Their udon is also usual thick udon thin (pretty much same soba in my opinion). I tried tempura soba ($ 17) it's hefty bowl noodle . You'll definitely full that . Their dessert all ranged around $10- $14 . Unfortunately In't get a chance try out they sounded delicious try not sweet (black sesame creme brûlée; yuzu mousse; etc .) They only split the bill 4 credit card.,4.0 star rating
6129,60,The basement izakaya styled sake storehouse (sake kura) packed Wednesday night . Even reservation 20 minute wait once inside; pleased pick an interesting menu segmented appetizer; salad; grilled meat veg; raw fish; fried food; stew; noodle rice ball . The pacing order our selection excellent made u forget wait be seated . We started day's special; yari-ika; type squid cut ika soman (noodle) style . It garnished shiso leaf; lemon slice; diced daikon smear grated ginger . The shiso best accompaniment this delicate squid dish we wish were provided . The next dish plate pickle; nukazuke . Unadorned pickle eggplant; carrot; daikon cucumber paved way next dish; onsen tamago uni ikura . The barely cooked egg soy broth balanced rich flavor uni ikura provided pop . I surprised find shirasu oroshi (steamed krill grated daikon) menu . I love shirasu eat often Tokyo . This dish fell little flat that the daikon had been squeezed most moisture provided dry base the shirasu . I wanted squeeze lemon bring back moisture . Buta kakuni seems be a popular dish; highlighted red the menu . It good; not exceptional . The tongue stew; the hand; a revelation . The tongue falling apart tender the accompanying vegetable were infused the rich beefy broth . Fittingly; the mentaiko onigiri came last . Although the cod roe salty spicy; plenty the perfectly cooked plain white rice balance the strong flavor . A long; crisp nori came the side wrap around the rice; a nice touch avoid a soggy; chewy onigiri . Sakakura's sister restaurant; Cha An; supply the dessert . The coffee anmitsu dessert tasty; although wa a bit a misnomer there wa not one drop an kuromitsu this dessert . Japanese food salty; this meal exemplified delicious saltiness.,4.0 star rating

We also got the black sesame creme brûlée w/ sesame ice cream dessert SOOOOOO GOOOD!!!!!!! $14 this dish very much worth it . They sesame 3 way . In the creme brûlée; the ice cream; top a toasted sesame garnish . So rich tasty . One our faves the night . Bill came to $85 tax tip 2 ppl .

6135,60,"I came on Sunday night around 7:30 pm without reservation . I seated right away bar . The service very minimal honestly I felt like server quite rude . I ordered pork belly; cold soba; onsen egg; chawamushi . The pork belly - I trouble``cutting""into smaller piece . Are supposed eat whole thing one bite? I think idea braise pork belly long enough skin softens; case . The skin softened; soft enough be cut chopstick not provide knife either . The good thing; seasoning done right . It quite tasty . I could see eating bowl rice . The Cold Soba Noodle - I liked; just normal soba noodle would expect a Japanese restaurant . Nothing really stood but not bad either.The Onsen Egg - egg cooked right . They ran of uni the night I ordered it they put extra ikura mine . I would like try the Ikura-uni combination . I would order it again . The Chawamushi - not favorite . Very blend tasteless (tasted the same the one I got across the street Sushi Yasuda). I'm used to the chawamushi a much flavorful broth (with the egg mixture); I wa really disappointed the chawamushi wa so tasteless.I not think I'll come back again I not enjoy my meal.",3.0 star rating
6136,60,It underground little bit hard find . But decoration very special.The dessert great . We ordered black sesami sake manju . The latter a red bean manju the flavor wine.The dish also good . The black edamome is my first time have.,4.0 star rating
6137,60,Came dinner three people . I would say definitely need reservation get pretty busy . Came via subway ;'s building basement . Nice decoration ambiance mood lighting . Portions most dish pretty small prepared . Got appetizer combo $16 they all pretty bad . We got ika shiokara aka squid; Amaebi Shutouae aka Chopped Raw Sweet Shrimp; Shirasu Oroshi aka Whitebait . The squid shrimp extremely fishy slimy strong flavor . The whitebait ok mixed daikon alleviate flavor . Each dish also small together would size one appetizer . Apparently're supposed be eating while drinking sake would taste better . Got couple entree share; entree also pretty small expect order than one per person . Got two daily special sashimi; came six piece . Pretty good fish quality wise . Each about $20 . Also got agedashi tofu pretty good; $9; karaage fried chicken; $12; came fresh delicious tender . No dipping sauce though I would liked . Also got the eggplant since good review; $8; disappointed 9 small stick eggplant three different sauce . Somehow looked bigger the picture . Also the flavor merely aite . Also got the grilled cod $12; good it one small filet; a little pricey . We got another filet I forget fish it wa; maybe salmon? We also got chawanmushi; two steamed egg dish $9 . Came a tea cup wa very good a good broth flavoring it . Last wa a serving the nihachi soba $14 . I would say is the only dish that is properly entree sized tho you may want order a side with it . It wa about average the dipping soup wa about average well . Service wa ok; total bill came to be about $200 made sad considering didn't eat that much food . Maybe had been interested the sake we would appreciated the wide selection we came food I would say are definitely better place le money . But come for the nicer setting.,3.0 star rating
6138,60,I must start by saying I base review comparison Soba Totto's BaraCharashi Special . The thing equal both soba noodle good; Sakaguru equal anything else.The place out way point person looking randomly eat would probably since's hidden . The restaurant had pretty spacious feel long bar section.Things I noted: The Chirashi ratio rice topping way . The seafood piece very small the rice hard tasted bit off.The service also good . My tea never refilled even getting the check bit chore . Although said would dessert; were never presented the check . It bit frustrating compare place; inevitable due the it being right next each eating basically the same dish.Sakaguran't have edamame; gave pickled vegetable (cabbage?). Alson't include a salad.In subterranean spot ;'s cell service; be aware that case're a Doctor someone's call emergency . If're not; good stop looking your phone and pay attention your food the person front you.Sakagura also cost a bit at $12; seems like a good value In't feel it wa worth that.,3.0 star rating
